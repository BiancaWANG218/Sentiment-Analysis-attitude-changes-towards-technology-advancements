INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>
BEGGAR , PLAYER .
</p>
<p>
Beggar .
</p>
<p>
If Poverty be a Title to Poetry , I am sure no-body can dispute mine .
I own myself of the Company of Beggars ; and I make one at their Weekly Festivals at St. Giles 's .
I have a small Yearly Salary for my Catches , and am welcome to a Dinner there whenever I please , which is more than most Poets can say .
</p>
<p>
Player .
As we live by the Muses , it is but Gratitude in us to encourage Poetical Merit wherever we find it .
The Muses , contrary to all other Ladies , pay no Distinction to Dress , and never partially mistake the Pertness of Embroidery for Wit , nor the Modesty of Want for Dulness .
Be the Author who he will , we push his Play as far as it will go .
So ( though you are in Want ) I wish you success heartily .
</p>
<p>
Beggar .
This piece I own was originally writ for the celebrating the Marriage of James Chaunter and Moll Lay , two most excellent Ballad-Singers .
I have introduced the Similes that are in all your celebrated Operas : The Swallow , the Moth , the Bee , the Ship , the Flower , &c. Besides , I have a Prison-Scene , which the Ladies always reckon charmingly pathetic .
As to the Parts , I have observed such a nice Impartiality to our two Ladies , that it is impossible for either of them to take Offence .
I hope I may be forgiven , that I have not made my Opera throughout unnatural , like those in vogue ; for I have no Recitative ; excepting this , as I have consented to have neither Prologue nor Epilogue , it must be allowed an Opera in all its Forms .
The Piece indeed hath been heretofore frequently represented by ourselves in our Great Room at St. Giles 's , so that I can not too often acknowledge your Charity in bringing it now on the Stage .
</p>
<p>
Player .
But I see it is time for us to withdraw ; the Actors are preparing to begin .
Play away the Overture .

</p>
<p>
ACT I. SCENE I .
</p>
<p>
SCENE , Peachum 's House .
</p>
<p>
Peachum sitting at a Table with a large Book of Accounts before him .
</p>
<p>
AIR I .
An old Woman clothed in Gray , &c..
</p>
<p>
[ Music ]
</p>
<p>
Through all the Employments of Life Each Neighbour abuses his Brother ; Whore and Rogue they call Husband and Wife : All Professions be-rogue one another : The Priest calls the Lawyer a Cheat , The Lawyer be-knaves the Divine : And the Statesman , because he 's so great , Thinks his Trade as honest as mine .
</p>
<p>
A Lawyer is an honest Employment , so is mine .
Like me too he acts in a double Capacity , both against Rogues and for 'em ; for 't is but fitting that we should protect and encourage Cheats , since we live by them .
</p>
<p>
Enter Filch .
</p>
<p>
Filch .
Sir , Black Moll hath sent word her Trial comes on in the Afternoon , and she hopes you will order Matters so as to bring her off .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
As the Wench is very active and industrious , you may satisfy her that I 'll soften the Evidence .
</p>
<p>
Filch .
Tom Gagg , Sir , is found guilty .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
A lazy Dog !
When I took him the time before , I told him what he would come to if he did not mend his Hand .
This is Death without Reprieve .
I may venture to Book him [ writes . ]
For Tom Gagg , forty Pounds .
Let Betty Sly know that I 'll save her from Transportation , for I can get more by her staying in England .
</p>
<p>
Filch .
Betty hath brought more Goods into our Lock to-year than any five of the Gang ; and in truth , 't is a pity to lose so good a Customer .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
If none of the Gang take her off , she may , in the common course of Business , live a Twelve-month longer .
I love to let Women scape .
A good Sportsman always lets the Hen Partridges fly , because the Breed of the Game depends upon them .
Besides , here the Law allows us no Reward ; there is nothing to be got by the Death of Women -- except our Wives .
</p>
<p>
Filch .
Without dispute , she is a fine Woman !
'T was to her I was obliged for my Education , and ( to say a bold Word ) she hath trained up more young Fellows to the Business than the Gaming table .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Truly , Filch , thy Observation is right .
We and the Surgeons are more beholden to Women than all the Professions besides .
</p>
<p>
AIR II .
The bonny gray-ey'd Morn , &c..
</p>
<p>
[ Music ]
</p>
<p>
Filch .
'T is Woman that seduces all Mankind , By her we first were taught the wheedling Arts : Her very Eyes can cheat ; when most she 's kind , She tricks us of our Money with our Hearts .
For her , like Wolves by Night we roam for Prey , And practise ev'ry Fraud to bribe her Charms ; For Suits of Love , like Law , are won by Pay , And Beauty must be fee'd into our Arms .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
But make haste to Newgate , Boy , and let my Friends know what I intend ; for I love to make them easy one way or other .
</p>
<p>
Filch .
When a Gentleman is long kept in suspence , Penitence may break his Spirit ever after .
Besides , Certainty gives a Man a good Air upon his Trial , and makes him risk another without Fear or Scruple .
But I 'll away , for 't is a Pleasure to be the Messenger of Comfort to Friends in Affliction .
[ Exit Filch .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
But 't is now high time to look about me for a decent Execution against next Sessions .
I hate a lazy Rogue , by whom one can get nothing 'till he is hang'd .
A Register of the Gang , [ Reading . ]
Crook-finger'd Jack .
A Year and a half in the Service ; Let me see how much the Stock owes to his industry ; one , two , three , four , five Gold Watches , and seven Silver ones .
A mighty clean-handed Fellow !
Sixteen Snuff-boxes , five of them of true Gold .
Six Dozen of Handkerchiefs , four silver-hilted Swords , half a Dozen of Shirts , three Tye-Periwigs , and a Piece of Broad-Cloth .
Considering these are only the Fruits of his leisure Hours , I do n't know a prettier Fellow , for no Man alive hath a more engaging Presence of Mind upon the Road .
Wat Dreary , alias Brown Will , an irregular Dog , who hath an underhand way of disposing of his Goods .
I 'll try him only for a Sessions or two longer upon his Good-behaviour .
Harry Paddington , a poor petty-larceny Rascal , without the least Genius ; that Fellow , though he were to live these six Months , will never come to the Gallows with any Credit .
Slippery Sam ; he goes off the next Sessions , for the Villain hath the Impudence to have Views of following his Trade as a Tailor , which he calls an honest Employment .
Mat of the Mint ; listed not above a Month ago , a promising sturdy Fellow , and diligent in his way ; somewhat too bold and hasty , and may raise good Contributions on the Public , if he does not cut himself short by Murder .
Tom Tipple , a guzzling soaking Sot , who is always too drunk to stand himself , or to make others stand .
A Cart is absolutely necessary for him .
Robin of Bagshot , alias Gorgon , alias Bluff Bob , alias Carbuncle , alias Bob Booty .
</p>
<p>
Enter Mrs. Peachum .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
What of Bob Booty , Husband ?
I hope nothing bad hath betided him .
You know , my Dear , he 's a favourite Customer of mine .
'T was he made me a present of this Ring .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
I have set his Name down in the Black List , that 's all , my Dear ; he spends his Life among Women , and as soon as his Money is gone , one or other of the Ladies will hang him for the Reward , and there 's forty Pound lost to us for-ever .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
You know , my Dear , I never meddle in matters of Death ; I always leave those Affairs to you .
Women indeed are bitter bad Judges in these cases , for they are so partial to the Brave that they think every Man handsome who is going to the Camp or the Gallows .
</p>
<p>
AIR III .
Cold and raw , &c..
</p>
<p>
[ Music ]
</p>
<p>
If any Wench Venus 's Girdle wear , Though she be never so ugly ; Lilies and Roses will quickly appear , And her Face look wond ` rous smugly .
Beneath the left Ear so fit but a Cord , ( A Rope so charming a Zone is ! )
The Youth in his Cart hath the Air of a Lord , And we cry , There dies an Adonis !
</p>
<p>
But really , Husband , you should not be too hard-hearted , for you never had a finer , braver set of Men than at present .
We have not had a Murder among them all , these seven Months .
And truly , my Dear , that is a great Blessing .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
What a dickens is the Woman always a whimpring about Murder for ?
No Gentleman is ever look'd upon the worse for killing a Man in his own Defence ; and if Business can not be carried on without it , what would you have a Gentleman do ?
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
If I am in the wrong , my Dear , you must excuse me , for no body can help the Frailty of an over-scrupulous Conscience .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Murder is as fashionable a Crime as a Man can be guilty of .
How many fine Gentlemen have we in Newgate every Year , purely upon that Article !
If they have wherewithal to persuade the Jury to bring it in Manslaughter , what are they the worse for it ?
So , my Dear , have done upon this Subject .
Was Captain Macheath here this Morning , for the Bank-Notes he left with you last Week ?
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Yes , my Dear ; and though the Bank hath stopt Payment , he was so chearful and so agreeable !
Sure there is not a finer Gentleman upon the Road than the Captain !
if he comes from Bagshot at any reasonable Hour , he hath promis'd to make one this Evening with Polly and me , and Bob Booty at a Party of Quadrille .
Pray , my Dear , is the Captain rich ?
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
The Captain keeps too good Company ever to grow rich .
Marybone and the Chocolate-houses are his Undoing .
The Man that proposes to get Money by play should have the Education of a fine Gentleman , and be train'd up to it from his Youth .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Really , I am sorry upon Polly 's Account the Captain hath not more Discretion .
What Business hath he to keep Company with Lords and Gentlemen ?
he should leave them to prey upon one another .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Upon Polly 's Account !
What , a Plague , does the Woman mean ?
-- Upon Polly 's Account !
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Captain Macheath is very fond of the Girl .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
And what then ?
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
If I have any Skill in the Ways of Women , I am sure Polly thinks him a very pretty Man .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
And what then ?
You would not be so mad to have the Wench marry him !
Gamesters and Highwaymen are generally very good to their Whores , but they are very Devils to their Wives .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
But if Polly should be in Love , how should we help her , or how can she help herself ?
Poor Girl , I am in the utmost Concern about her .
</p>
<p>
AIR IV .
Why is your faithful Slave disdain'd ?
&c..
</p>
<p>
[ Music ]
</p>
<p>
If Love the Virgin 's Heart invade , How , like a Moth , the simple Maid Still plays about the Flame !
If soon she be not made a Wife , Her Honour 's sing'd , and then for Life , She 's -- what I dare not name .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Look ye , Wife .
A handsome Wench in our way of Business is as profitable as at the Bar of a Temple Coffee-House , who looks upon it as her livelihood to grant every Liberty but one .
You see I would indulge the Girl as far as prudently we can .
In any thing , but Marriage !
After that , my Dear , how shall we be safe ?
Are we not then in her Husband 's Power ?
For a Husband hath the absolute Power over all a Wife 's Secrets but her own .
If the Girl had the Discretion of a Court-Lady , who can have a Dozen young Fellows at her Ear without complying with one , I should not matter it ; but Polly is Tinder , and a Spark will at once set her on a Flame .
Married !
If the Wench does not know her own Profit , sure she knows her own Pleasure better than to make herself a Property !
My Daughter to me should be , like a Court-Lady to a Minister of State , a Key to the whole Gang .
Married !
If the Affair is not already done , I 'll terrify her from it , by the Example of our Neighbours .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
May-hap , my Dear , you may injure the Girl .
She loves to imitate the fine Ladies , and she may only allow the Captain Liberties in the view of Interest .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
But 't is your Duty , my Dear , to warn the Girl against her Ruin , and to instruct her how to make the most of her Beauty .
I 'll go to her this moment , and sift her .
In the meantime , Wife , rip out the Coronets and Marks of these Dozen of Cambric Handkerchiefs , for I can dispose of them this Afternoon to a Chap in the City .
</p>
<p>
[ Exit Peachum .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Never was a Man more out of the way in an Argument than my Husband !
Why must our Polly , forsooth , differ from her Sex , and love only her Husband ?
And why must Polly 's Marriage , contrary to all Observations , make her the less followed by other Men ?
All Men are Thieves in Love , and like a Woman the better for being another 's Property .
</p>
<p>
AIR V. Of all the simple Things we do , &c..
</p>
<p>
[ Music ]
</p>
<p>
A Maid is like the Golden Ore , Which hath Guineas intrinsical i n't , Whose Worth is never known before It is try'd and imprest in the Mint .
A Wife 's like a Guinea in Gold , Stampt with the Name of her Spouse ; Now here , now there ; is bought , or is sold ; And is current in every House .
</p>
<p>
Enter Filch .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Come hither , Filch .
I am as fond of this Child , as though my Mind misgave me he were my own .
He hath as fine a Hand at picking a Pocket as a Woman , and is as nimble-finger'd as a Juggler .
If an unlucky Session does not cut the Rope of thy Life , I pronounce , Boy , thou wilt be a great Man in History .
Where was your Post last Night , my Boy ?
</p>
<p>
Filch .
I ply'd at the Opera , Madam ; and considering 't was neither dark nor rainy , so that there was no great Hurry in getting Chairs and Coaches , made a tolerable Hand o n't .
These seven Handkerchiefs , Madam .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Colour'd ones , I see .
They are of sure Sale from our Warehouse at Redriff among the Seamen .
</p>
<p>
Filch .
And this Snuff-box .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Set in Gold !
A pretty Encouragement this to a young Beginner .
</p>
<p>
Filch .
I had a fair Tug at a charming Gold Watch .
Pox take the Tailors for making the Fobs so deep and narrow !
It stuck by the way , and I was forc'd to make my Escape under a Coach .
Really , Madam , I fear I shall be cut off in the Flower of my Youth , so that every now and then ( since I was pumpt ) I have Thoughts of taking up and going to Sea .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
You should go to Hockley in the Hole , and to Marybone , Child , to learn Valour .
These are the Schools that have bred so many brave Men .
I thought , Boy , by this time , thou hadst lost Fear as well as Shame .
Poor Lad !
how little does he know as yet of the Old Baily !
For the first Fact I 'll insure thee from being hang'd ; and going to Sea , Filch , will come time enough upon a Sentence of Transportation .
But now , since you have nothing better to do , ev'n go to your Book , and learn your Catechism ; for really a Man makes but an ill Figure in the Ordinary 's Paper , who can not give a satisfactory Answer to his Questions .
But , hark you , my Lad .
Do n't tell me a Lye ; for you know I hate a Liar .
Do you know of anything that hath pass'd between Captain Macheath and our Polly ?
</p>
<p>
Filch .
I beg you , Madam , do n't ask me ; for I must either tell a Lye to you or to Miss Polly ; for I promis'd her I would not tell .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
But when the Honour of our Family is concern'd --
</p>
<p>
Filch .
I shall lead a sad Life with Miss Polly , if ever she comes to know that I told you .
Besides , I would not willingly forfeit my own Honour by betraying any body .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Yonder comes my Husband and Polly .
Come , Filch , you shall go with me into my own Room , and tell me the whole Story .
I 'll give thee a Glass of a most delicious Cordial that I keep for my own drinking .
</p>
<p>
[ Exeunt .
</p>
<p>
Enter Peachum , Polly .
</p>
<p>
Polly .
I know as well as any of the fine Ladies how to make the most of myself and of my Man too .
A Woman knows how to be mercenary , though she hath never been in a Court or at an Assembly .
We have it in our Natures , Papa .
If I allow Captain Macheath some trifling Liberties , I have this Watch and other visible Marks of his Favour to shew for it .
A Girl who can not grant some Things , and refuse what is most material , will make but a poor hand of her Beauty , and soon be thrown upon the Common .
</p>
<p>
AIR VI .
What shall I do to shew how much I love her , &c..
</p>
<p>
[ Music ]
</p>
<p>
Virgins are like the fair Flower in its Lustre , Which in the Garden enamels the Ground ; Near it the Bees in play flutter and cluster , And gaudy Butterflies frolick around .
But , when once pluck'd , 't is no longer alluring , To Covent-Garden 't is sent ( as yet sweet ) , There fades , and shrinks , and grows past all enduring , Rots , stinks , and dies , and is trod under feet .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
You know , Polly , I am not against your toying and trifling with a Customer in the way of Business , or to get out a Secret , or so .
But if I find out that you have play'd the Fool and are married , you Jade you , I 'll cut your Throat , Hussy .
Now you know my Mind .
</p>
<p>
Enter Mrs. Peachum , in a very great Passion .
</p>
<p>
AIR VII .
Oh London is a fine Town .
</p>
<p>
[ Music ]
</p>
<p>
Our Polly is a sad Slut !
nor heeds what we have taught her .
I wonder any Man alive will ever rear a Daughter !
For she must have both Hoods and Gowns , and Hoops to swell her Pride , With Scarfs and Stays , and Gloves and Lace ; and she will have Men beside ; And when she 's drest with Care and Cost , all tempting , fine and gay , As Men should serve a Cucumber , she flings herself away .
Our Polly is a sad Slut !
&c..
</p>
<p>
You Baggage !
you Hussy !
you inconsiderate Jade !
had you been hang'd , it would not have vex'd me , for that might have been your Misfortune ; but to do such a mad thing by Choice ; The Wench is married , Husband .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Married !
the Captain is a bold Man , and will risk any thing for Money ; to be sure he believes her a Fortune .
Do you think your Mother and I should have liv'd comfortably so long together , if ever we had been married ?
Baggage !
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
I knew she was always a proud Slut ; and now the Wench hath play'd the Fool and Married , because forsooth she would do like the Gentry .
Can you support the Expence of a Husband , Hussy , in Gaming , Drinking and Whoring ?
Have you Money enough to carry on the daily Quarrels of Man and Wife about who shall squander most ?
There are not many Husbands and Wives , who can bear the Charges of plaguing one another in a handsom way .
If you must be married , could you introduce no body into our Family but a Highwayman ?
Why , thou foolish Jade , thou wilt be as ill-us'd , and as much neglected , as if thou hadst married a Lord !
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Let not your Anger , my Dear , break through the Rules of Decency , for the Captain looks upon himself in the Military Capacity , as a Gentleman by his Profession .
Besides what he hath already , I know he is in a fair way of getting , or of dying ; and both these ways , let me tell you , are most excellent Chances for a Wife .
Tell me , Hussy , are you ruin'd or no ?
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
With Polly 's Fortune , she might very well have gone off to a Person of Distinction .
Yes , that you might , you pouting Slut !
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
What is the Wench dumb ?
Speak , or I 'll make you plead by squeezing out an Answer from you .
Are you really bound Wife to him , or are you only upon liking ?
[ Pinches her .
</p>
<p>
Polly .
Oh !
[ Screaming .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
How the Mother is to be pitied who hath handsom Daughters !
Locks , Bolts , Bars , and Lectures of Morality are nothing to them : They break through them all .
They have as much Pleasure in cheating a Father and Mother , as in cheating at Cards .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Why , Polly , I shall soon know if you are married , by Macheath 's keeping from our House .
</p>
<p>
AIR VIII .
Grim King of the Ghosts , &c..
</p>
<p>
[ Music ]
</p>
<p>
Polly .
Can Love be control'd by Advice ?
Will Cupid our Mothers obey ?
Though my Heart were as frozen as Ice , At his Flame 'twould have melted away .
When he kist me so closely he prest , 'T was so sweet that I must have comply'd : So I thought it both safest and best To marry , for fear you should chide .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Then all the Hopes of our Family are gone for ever and ever !
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
And Macheath may hang his Father and Mother-in-law , in hope to get into their Daughter 's Fortune .
</p>
<p>
Polly .
I did not marry him ( as 't is the Fashion ) coolly and deliberately for Honour or Money .
But , I love him .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Love him !
worse and worse !
I thought the Girl had been better bred .
Oh Husband , Husband !
her Folly makes me mad !
my Head swims !
I 'm distracted !
I ca n't support myself -- Oh !
[ Faints .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
See , Wench , to what a Condition you have reduc'd your poor Mother !
a Glass of Cordial , this instant .
How the poor Woman takes it to heart !
</p>
<p>
[ Polly goes out , and returns with it .
</p>
<p>
Ah , Hussy , now this is the only Comfort your Mother has left !
</p>
<p>
Polly .
Give her another Glass , Sir !
my Mama drinks double the Quantity whenever she is out of Order .
This , you see , fetches her .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
The Girl shews such a Readiness , and so much Concern , that I could almost find in my Heart to forgive her .
</p>
<p>
AIR IX .
O Jenny , O Jenny , where hast thou been .
</p>
<p>
[ Music ]
</p>
<p>
O Polly , you might have toy'd and kist .
By keeping Men off , you keep them on .
</p>
<p>
Polly .
But he so teaz'd me , And he so pleas'd me , What I did , you must have done .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Not with a Highwayman .
-- You sorry Slut !
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
A Word with you , Wife .
'T is no new thing for a Wench to take Man without Consent of Parents .
You know 't is the Frailty of Women , my Dear .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Yes , indeed , the Sex is frail .
But the first time a Woman is frail , she should be somewhat nice methinks , for then or never is the time to make her Fortune .
After that , she hath nothing to do but to guard herself from being found out , and she may do what she pleases .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Make yourself a little easy ; I have a Thought shall soon set all Matters again to rights .
Why so melancholy , Polly ?
since what is done can not be undone , we must all endeavour to make the best of it .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Well , Polly ; as far as one Woman can forgive another , I forgive thee .
-- Your Father is too fond of you , Hussy .
</p>
<p>
Polly .
Then all my Sorrows are at an end .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
A mighty likely Speech in troth , for a Wench who is just married !
</p>
<p>
AIR X. Thomas , I can not , &c..
</p>
<p>
[ Music ]
</p>
<p>
Polly .
I , like a Ship in Storms , was tost ; Yet afraid to put in to Land : For seiz'd in the Port the Vessel 's lost , Whose Treasure is contreband .
The Waves are laid , My Duty 's paid .
O Joy beyond Expression !
Thus , safe a-shore , I ask no more , My All is in my Possession .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
I hear Customers in t ` other Room : Go , talk with 'em , Polly ; but come to us again , as soon as they are gone .
-- But , hark ye , Child , if 't is the Gentleman who was here Yesterday about the Repeating Watch ; say , you believe we ca n't get Intelligence of it 'till to-morrow .
For I lent it to Suky Straddle , to make a figure with it to-night at a Tavern in Drury-Lane .
If t ` other Gentleman calls for the Silver-hilted Sword ; you know Beetle-brow'd Jemmy hath it on , and he doth not come from Tunbridge 'till Tuesday Night ; so that it can not be had 'till then .
</p>
<p>
[ Exit Polly .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Dear Wife , be a little pacified , Do n't let your Passion run away with your Senses .
Polly , I grant you , hath done a rash thing .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
If she had only an Intrigue with the Fellow , why the very best Families have excus'd and huddled up a Frailty of that sort .
'T is Marriage , Husband , that makes it a Blemish .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
But Money , Wife , is the true Fuller 's Earth for Reputations , there is not a Spot or a Stain but what it can take out .
A rich Rogue now-a-days is fit Company for any Gentleman ; and the World , my Dear , hath not such a Contempt for Roguery as you imagine .
I tell you , Wife , I can make this Match turn to our Advantage .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
I am very sensible , Husband , that Captain Macheath is worth Money , but I am in doubt whether he hath not two or three Wives already , and then if he should die in a Session or two , Polly 's Dower would come into Dispute .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
That , indeed , is a Point which ought to be consider'd .

A Fox may steal your Hens , Sir , A Whore your Health and Pence , Sir , Your Daughter rob your Chest , Sir , Your Wife may steal your Rest , Sir .
A Thief your Goods and Plate .
But this is all but picking , With Rest , Pence , Chest and Chicken ; It ever was decreed , Sir , If Lawyer 's Hand is fee'd , Sir , He steals your whole Estate .
</p>
<p>
The Lawyers are bitter Enemies to those in our Way .
They do n't care that any body should get a clandestine Livelihood but themselves .
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Polly .
'T was only Nimming Ned .
He brought in a Damask Window-Curtain , a Hoop-Petticoat , a pair of Silver Candlesticks , a Periwig , and one Silk Stocking , from the Fire that happen'd last Night .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
There is not a Fellow that is cleverer in his way , and saves more Goods out of the Fire than Ned .
But now , Polly , to your Affair ; for Matters must not be left as they are .
You are married then , it seems ?
</p>
<p>
Polly .
Yes , Sir .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
And how do you propose to live , Child ?
</p>
<p>
Polly .
Like other Women , Sir , upon the Industry of my Husband .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
What , is the Wench turn'd Fool ?
A Highwayman 's Wife , like a Soldier 's , hath as little of his Pay , as of his Company .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
And had not you the common Views of a Gentlewoman in your Marriage , Polly ?
</p>
<p>
Polly .
I do n't know what you mean , Sir .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Of a Jointure , and of being a Widow .
</p>
<p>
Polly .
But I love him , Sir ; how then could I have Thoughts of parting with him ?
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Parting with him !
Why , this is the whole Scheme and Intention of all Marriage-Articles .
The comfortable Estate of Widow-hood , is the only Hope that keeps up a Wife 's Spirits .
Where is the Woman who would scruple to be a Wife , if she had it in her Power to be a Widow , whenever she pleas'd ?
If you have any Views of this sort , Polly , I shall think the Match not so very unreasonable .
</p>
<p>
Polly .
How I dread to hear your Advice !
Yet I must beg you to explain yourself .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Secure what he hath got , have him peach'd the next Sessions , and then at once you are made a rich Widow .
</p>
<p>
Polly .
What , murder the Man I love !
The Blood runs cold at my Heart with the very thought of it .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Fie , Polly !
What hath Murder to do in the Affair ?
Since the thing sooner or later must happen , I dare say , the Captain himself would like that we should get the Reward for his Death sooner than a Stranger .
Why , Polly , the Captain knows , that as 't is his Employment to rob , so 't is ours to take Robbers ; every Man in his Business .
So that there is no Malice in the Case .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Ay , Husband , now you have nick'd the Matter .
To have him peach'd is the only thing could ever make me forgive her .

Mrs. Peachum .
But your Duty to your Parents , Hussy , obliges you to hang him .
What would many a Wife give for such an Opportunity !
</p>
<p>
Polly .
What is a Jointure , what is Widow-hood to me ?
I know my Heart .
I can not survive him .

I hate thee for being particular : Why , Wench , thou art a Shame to thy very Sex .
</p>
<p>
Polly .
But hear me , Mother .
-- If you ever lov'd --
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Those cursed Play-Books she reads have been her Ruin .
One Word more , Hussy , and I shall knock your Brains out , if you have any .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Keep out of the way , Polly , for fear of Mischief , and consider of what is proposed to you .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
Away , Hussy .

</p>
<p>
[ Exit Polly .

<p>

</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
The Thing , Husband , must and shall be done .
For the sake of Intelligence we must take other measures , and have him peached the next Session without her Consent .
If she will not know her Duty , we know ours .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
But really , my Dear , it grieves one 's Heart to take off a great Man .
When I consider his Personal Bravery , his fine Stratagem , how much we have already got by him , and how much more we may get , methinks I ca n't find in my Heart to have a hand in his Death .
I wish you could have made Polly undertake it .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
But in a Case of Necessity -- our own Lives are in danger .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Then , indeed , we must comply with the Customs of the World , and make Gratitude give way to Interest .
-- He shall be taken off .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Peachum .
I 'll undertake to manage Polly .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
And I 'll prepare Matters for the Old-Baily .
</p>
<p>
[ Exeunt severally .
</p>
<p>
Polly .
Now I 'm a Wretch , indeed .
-- Methinks I see him already in the Cart , sweeter and more lovely than the Nosegay in his Hand !
-- I hear the Crowd extolling his Resolution and Intrepidity !
-- What Vollies of Sighs are sent from the Windows of Holborn , that so comely a Youth should be brought to Disgrace !
-- I see him at the Tree !
The whole Circle are in Tears !
-- even Butchers weep !
-- Jack Ketch himself hesitates to perform his Duty , and would be glad to lose his Fee , by a Reprieve .
What then will become of Polly !
-- As yet I may inform him of their Design , and aid him in his Escape .
-- It shall be so -- But then he flies , absents himself , and I bar myself from his dear dear Conversation !
That too will distract me .
-- If he keep out of the way , my Papa and Mama may in time relent , and we may be happy .
-- If he stays , he is hang'd , and then he is lost for ever !
-- He intended to lie conceal'd in my Room , 'till the Dusk of the Evening : If they are abroad I 'll this Instant let him out , lest some Accident should prevent him .

Macheath .
Is there any Power , any Force that could tear me from thee ?

<p>
A TAVERN near Newgate .
</p>
<p>
Jemmy Twitcher , Crook-finger'd Jack , Wat Dreary , Robin of Bagshot , Nimming Ned , Henry Paddington , Matt of the Mint , Ben Budge , and the rest of the Gang , at the Table , with Wine , Brandy and Tobacco .
</p>
<p>
Ben .
But pr ` ythee , Matt , what is become of thy Brother Tom ?
I have not seen him since my Return from Transportation .
</p>
<p>
Matt .
Poor Brother Tom had an Accident this time Twelve-month , and so clever a made fellow he was , that I could not save him from those fleaing Rascals the Surgeons ; and now , poor Man , he is among the Otamys at Surgeons Hall .
</p>
<p>
Ben .
So it seems , his Time was come .
</p>
<p>
Jemmy .
But the present Time is ours , and no body alive hath more .
Why are the Laws levell'd at us ?
are we more dishonest than the rest of Mankind ?
What we win , Gentlemen , is our own by the Law of Arms , and the Right of Conquest .
</p>
<p>
Crook .
Where shall we find such another Set of Practical Philosophers , who to a Man are above the Fear of Death ?
</p>
<p>
Wat .

<p>
Robin .
Of try'd Courage , and indefatigable Industry !
</p>
<p>
Ned .
Who is there here that would not die for his Friend ?
</p>
<p>
Harry .
Who is there here that would betray him for his Interest ?
</p>
<p>
Matt .
Shew me a Gang of Courtiers that can say as much .
</p>
<p>
Ben .
We are for a just Partition of the World , for every Man hath a Right to enjoy Life .
</p>
<p>
Matt .
We retrench the Superfluities of Mankind .
The World is avaritious , and I hate Avarice .
A covetous fellow , like a Jackdaw , steals what he was never made to enjoy , for the sake of hiding it .
These are the Robbers of Mankind , for Money was made for the Free-hearted and Generous , and where is the Injury of taking from another , what he hath not the Heart to make use of ?

<p>
Macheath .
Gentlemen , well met .
My Heart hath been with you this Hour ; but an unexpected Affair hath detain'd me .
No Ceremony , I beg you .
</p>
<p>
Matt .
We were just breaking up to go upon Duty .
Am I to have the Honour of taking the Air with you , Sir , this Evening upon the Heath ?
I drink a Dram now and then with the Stagecoachmen in the way of Friendship and Intelligence ; and I know that about this Time there will be Passengers upon the Western Road , who are worth speaking with .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
I was to have been of that Party -- but --
</p>
<p>
Matt .
But what , Sir ?
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
Is there any Man who suspects my Courage ?
</p>
<p>
Matt .
We have all been Witnesses of it .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
My Honour and Truth to the Gang ?
</p>
<p>
Matt .
I 'll be answerable for it .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
In the Division of our Booty , have I ever shewn the least Marks of Avarice or Injustice ?
</p>
<p>
Matt .
By these Questions something seems to have ruffled you .
Are any of us suspected ?
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
I have a fixed Confidence , Gentlemen , in you all , as Men of Honour , and as such I value and respect you .
Peachum is a Man that is useful to us .
</p>
<p>
Matt .
Is he about to play us any foul Play ?
I 'll shoot him through the Head .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
I beg you , Gentlemen , act with Conduct and Discretion .
A Pistol is your last Resort .
</p>
<p>
Matt .
He knows nothing of this Meeting .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
Business can not go on without him .
He is a Man who knows the World , and is a necessary Agent to us .
We have had a slight Difference , and 'till it is accommodated I shall be oblig'd to keep out of his way .
Any private Dispute of mine shall be of no ill consequence to my Friends .
You must continue to act under his Direction , for the moment we break loose from him , our Gang is ruin'd .
</p>
<p>
Matt .
As a Bawd to a Whore , I grant you , he is to us of great Convenience .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
Make him believe I have quitted the Gang , which I can never do but with Life .
At our private Quarters I will continue to meet you .
A Week or so will probably reconcile us .
</p>
<p>
Matt .
Your Instructions shall be observ'd .
'T is now high time for us to repair to our several Duties ; so 'till the Evening at our Quarters in Moor-Fields we bid you farewel .
</p>

I shall wish myself with you .

You are always so taken up with stealing Hearts , that you do n't allow yourself Time to steal any thing else .

Mrs. Vixen , I 'm yours , I always lov'd a Woman of Wit and Spirit ; they make charming Mistresses , but plaguy Wives -- Betty Doxy !
Come hither , Hussy .
Do you drink as hard as ever ?
You had better stick to good wholesom Beer ; for in troth , Betty , Strong-Waters will in time ruin your Constitution .
You should leave those to your Betters .
-- What !
and my pretty Jenny Diver too !
As prim and demure as ever !
There is not any Prude , though ever so high bred , hath a more sanctify'd Look , with a more mischievous Heart .
Ah !

I seize you , Sir , as my Prisoner .
</p>

Macheath .
Was this well done , Jenny ?
-- Women are Decoy Ducks ; who can trust them !
Beasts , Jades , Jilts , Harpies , Furies , Whores !
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Your Case , Mr. Macheath , is not particular .
The greatest Heroes have been ruin'd by Women .
But , to do them Justice , I must own they are a pretty sort of Creatures , if we could trust them .
You must now , Sir , take your Leave of the Ladies , and if they have a mind to make you a Visit , they will be sure to find you at home .
This Gentleman , Ladies , lodges in Newgate .
Constables , wait upon the Captain to his Lodgings .

Look ye , Mrs. Jenny , though Mr. Peachum may have made a private Bargain with you and Suky Tawdry for betraying the Captain , as we were all assisting , we ought all to share alike .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Coaxer .
I think Mr. Peachum , after so long an Acquaintance , might have trusted me as well as Jenny Diver .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Slammekin .
I am sure at least three Men of his hanging , and in a Year 's time too ( if he did me Justice ) should be set down to my Account .
</p>
<p>
Trull .
Mrs. Slammekin , that is not fair .
For you know one of them was taken in Bed with me .

As far as a Bowl of Punch or a Treat , I believe Mrs. Suky will join with me .

<p>
Lockit .
Noble Captain , you are welcome .
You have not been a Lodger of mine this Year and half .
You know the Custom , Sir .
Garnish , Captain , Garnish .
Hand me down those Fetters there .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
Those , Mr. Lockit , seem to be the heaviest of the whole Set .
With your Leave , I should like the further Pair better .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
Look ye , Captain , we know what is fittest for our Prisoners .
When a Gentleman uses me with Civility , I always do the best I can to please him .
-- Hand them down I say .
-- We have them of all Prices , from one Guinea to ten , and 't is fitting every Gentleman should please himself .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
I understand you , Sir .
[ Gives Money . ]
The Fees here are so many , and so exorbitant , that few Fortunes can bear the Expence of getting off handsomly , or of dying like a Gentleman .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
Those , I see , will fit the Captain better -- Take down the further Pair .
Do but examine them , Sir .
-- Never was better work .
-- How genteely they are made !
-- They will fit as easy as a Glove , and the nicest Man in England might not be asham'd to wear them .
[ He puts on the Chains . ]
If I had the best Gentleman in the Land in my Custody I could not equip him more handsomly .
And so , Sir -- I now leave you to your private Meditations .

Man may escape from Rope and Gun ; Nay , some have out liv'd the Doctor 's Pill ; Who takes a Woman must be undone , That Basilisk is sure to kill .
The Fly that sips Treacle is lost in the Sweets , So he that tastes Woman , Woman , Woman , He that tastes Woman , ruin meets .
</p>
<p>
To what a woful Plight have I brought myself !
Here must I ( all Day long , 'till I am hang'd ) be confin'd to hear the Reproaches of a Wench who lays her Ruin at my Door -- I am in the Custody of her Father , and to be sure , if he knows of the matter , I shall have a fine time o n't betwixt this and my Execution .
-- But I promis'd the Wench Marriage -- What signifies a Promise to a Woman ?
Does not Man in Marriage itself promise a hundred things that he never means to perform ?
Do all we can , Women will believe us ; for they look upon a Promise as an Excuse for following their own Inclinations .
-- But here comes Lucy , and I can not get from her .
-- Wou'd I were deaf !
</p>
<p>
Enter Lucy .
</p>
<p>
Lucy .
You base Man you , -- how can you look me in the Face after what hath passed between us ?
-- See here , perfidious Wretch , how I am forc'd to bear about the Load of Infamy you have laid upon me -- O Macheath !
thou hast robb'd me of my Quiet -- to see thee tortur'd would give me Pleasure .

Thus when a good Housewife sees a Rat In her Trap in the Morning taken , With Pleasure her Heart goes pit-a-pat , In Revenge for her Loss of Bacon .
Then she throws him To the Dog or Cat , To be worried , crush'd and shaken .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
Have you no Bowels , no Tenderness , my dear Lucy , to see a Husband in these Circumstances ?
</p>
<p>
Lucy .
A Husband !
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
In ev'ry Respect but the Form , and that , my Dear , may be said over us at any time .
-- Friends should not insist upon Ceremonies .
From a Man of Honour , his Word is as good as his Bond .

Lucy .
'T is the Pleasure of all you fine Men to insult the Women you have ruin'd .
</p>
<p>
AIR XXVII .
'T was when the Sea was roaring , &c..
</p>
<p>
[ Music ]
</p>
<p>
How cruel are the Traitors , Who lye and swear in jest , To cheat unguarded Creatures Of Virtue , Fame , and Rest !
Whoever steals a Shilling , Through Shame the Guilt conceals : In Love the perjur'd Villain With Boasts the Theft reveals .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
The very first Opportunity , my Dear , ( have but Patience ) you shall be my Wife in whatever manner you please .
</p>
<p>
Lucy .
Insinuating Monster !
And so you think I know nothing of the Affair of Miss Polly Peachum .
-- I could tear thy Eyes out !
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
Sure , Lucy , you ca n't be such a Fool as to be jealous of Polly !
</p>
<p>
Lucy .
Are you not married to her , you Brute , you .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
Married !
Very good .
The Wench gives it out only to vex thee , and to ruin me in thy good Opinion .
'T is true , I go to the House ; I chat with the Girl , I kiss her , I say a thousand things to her ( as all Gentlemen do ) that mean nothing , to divert myself ; and now the silly Jade hath set it about that I am married to her , to let me know what she would be at .
Indeed , my dear Lucy , these violent Passions may be of ill consequence to a Woman in your Condition .
</p>
<p>
Lucy .
Come , come , Captain , for all your Assurance , you know that Miss Polly hath put it out of your Power to do me the Justice you promis'd me .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
A jealous Woman believes every thing her Passion suggests .
To convince you of my Sincerity , if we can find the Ordinary , I shall have no Scruples of making you my Wife ; and I know the Consequence of having two at a time .
</p>
<p>
Lucy .
That you are only to be hang'd , and so get rid of them both .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
I am ready , my dear Lucy , to give you Satisfaction -- if you think there is any in Marriage .
-- What can a Man of Honour say more ?
</p>
<p>
Lucy .
So then , it seems , you are not married to Miss Polly .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
You know , Lucy , the Girl is prodigiously conceited .
No Man can say a civil thing to her , but ( like other fine Ladies ) her Vanity makes her think he 's her own for ever and ever .

AIR XXVIII .

[ Music ]
</p>
<p>
The first time at the Looking-glass The Mother sets her Daughter , The Image strikes the smiling Lass With Self-love ever after , Each time she looks , she , fonder grown , Thinks ev'ry Charm grows stronger .
But alas , vain Maid , all Eyes but your own Can see you are not younger .
</p>
<p>
When Women consider their own Beauties , they are all alike unreasonable in their Demands ; for they expect their Lovers should like them as long as they like themselves .
</p>
<p>
Lucy .
Yonder is my Father -- perhaps this way we may light upon the Ordinary , who shall try if you will be as good as your Word .
-- For I long to be made an honest Woman .
</p>
<p>
[ Exeunt .
</p>
<p>
Enter Peachum and Lockit with an Account-Book .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
In this last Affair , Brother Peachum , we are agreed .
You have consented to go halves in Macheath .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
We shall never fall out about an Execution -- But as to that Article , pray how stands our last Year 's Account ?
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
If you will run your Eye over it , you 'll find 't is fair and clearly stated .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
This long Arrear of the Government is very hard upon us !
Can it be expected that we would hang our Acquaintance for nothing , when our Betters will hardly save theirs without being paid for it .
Unless the People in Employment pay better , I promise them for the future , I shall let other Rogues live besides their own .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
Perhaps , Brother , they are afraid these Matters may be carried too far .
We are treated too by them with Contempt , as if our Profession were not reputable .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
In one respect indeed our Employment may be reckon'd dishonest , because , like Great Statesmen , we encourage those who betray their Friends .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
Such Language , Brother , any where else , might turn to your Prejudice .
Learn to be more guarded , I beg you .

When you censure the Age , Be cautious and sage , Lest the Courtiers offended should be : If you mention Vice or Bribe , 'T is so pat to all the Tribe ; Each cries -- That was levell'd at me .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Here 's poor Ned Clincher 's Name , I see .
Sure , Brother Lockit , there was a little unfair Proceeding in Ned 's Case : for he told me in the Condemn'd Hold , that for Value receiv'd , you had promis'd him a Session or two longer without Molestation .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
Mr. Peachum -- this is the first time my Honour was ever call'd in Question .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Business is at an end -- if once we act dishonourably .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
Who accuses me ?
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
You are warm , Brother .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
He that attacks my Honour , attacks my Livelihood .
-- And this Usage -- Sir -- is not to be borne .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Since you provoke me to speak -- I must tell you too , that Mrs. Coaxer charges you with defrauding her of her Information-Money , for the apprehending of curl-pated Hugh .
Indeed , indeed , Brother , we must punctually pay our Spies , or we shall have no Information .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
Is this Language to me , Sirrah , -- who have sav'd you from the Gallows , Sirrah !
[ Collaring each other .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
If I am hang'd , it shall be for ridding the World of an arrant Rascal .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
This Hand shall do the Office of the Halter you deserve , and throttle you -- you Dog !
--
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Brother , Brother -- We are both in the Wrong -- We shall be both Losers in the Dispute -- for you know we have it in our Power to hang each other .
You should not be so passionate .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
Nor you so provoking .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
'T is our mutual Interest ; 't is for the Interest of the World we should agree .
If I said any thing , Brother , to the Prejudice of your Character , I ask pardon .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
Brother Peachum -- I can forgive as well as resent .
-- Give me your Hand .
Suspicion does not become a Friend .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
I only meant to give you Occasion to justify yourself : But I must now step home , for I expect the Gentleman about this Snuff-box , that Filch nimm'd two Nights ago in the Park .
I appointed him at this Hour .

You have then been whimpering and fondling , like a Spaniel , over the Fellow that hath abus'd you .

One ca n't help Love ; one ca n't cure it .
'T is not in my Power to obey you , and hate him .

Lockit .
Learn to bear your Husband 's Death like a reasonable Woman .
'T is not the fashion , now-a-days , so much as to affect Sorrow upon these Occasions .

But if I could raise a small Sum -- Would not twenty Guineas , think you , move him ?

Come , Hussy , do n't cheat your Father ; and I shall not be angry with you -- Perhaps , you have made a better Bargain with him than I could have done -- How much , my good Girl ?

You know , Sir , I am fond of him , and would have given Money to have kept him with me .

When young at the Bar you first taught me to score , And bid me be free of my Lips , and no more ; I was kiss'd by the Parson , the Squire , and the Sot , When the Guest was departed , the Kiss was forgot .
But his Kiss was so sweet , and so closely he prest , That I languish'd and pin'd till I granted the rest .
</p>
<p>
If you can forgive me , Sir , I will make a fair Confession , for to be sure he hath been a most barbarous Villain to me .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
And so you have let him escape , Hussy -- Have you ?

When a Woman loves ; a kind Look , a tender Word can persuade her to any thing -- And I could ask no other Bribe .

But Love , Sir , is a Misfortune that may happen to the most discreet Women , and in Love we are all Fools alike -- Notwithstanding all he swore , I am now fully convinc'd that Polly Peachum is actually his Wife .
-- Did I let him escape , ( Fool that I was ! )
to go to her ?
-- Polly will wheedle herself into his Money , and then Peachum will hang him , and cheat us both .

Thus Gamesters united in Friendship are found , Though they know that their Industry all is a Cheat ; They flock to their Prey at the Dice-Box 's Sound , And join to promote one another 's Deceit .
But if by mishap They fail of a Chap , To keep in their Hands , they each other entrap .
Like Pikes , lank with Hunger , who miss of their Ends , They bite their Companions , and prey on their Friends .

In sorrowful Ditty , They promise , they pity , But shift for your Money , from Friend to Friend .

</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Why , look ye , Mrs. Dye -- you deal so hard with us , that we can afford to give the Gentlemen , who venture their Lives for the Goods , little or nothing .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trapes .
The hard Times oblige me to go very near in my Dealing .
-- To be sure , of late Years I have been a great Sufferer by the Parliament .
-- Three thousand Pounds would hardly make me amends .
-- The Act for destroying the Mint , was a severe Cut upon our Business -- 'Till then , if a Customer stept out of the way -- we knew where to have her -- No doubt you know Mrs. Coaxer -- there 's a Wench now ( 'till to-day ) with a good Suit of Clothes of mine upon her Back , and I could never set Eyes upon her for three Months together .
-- Since the Act too against Imprisonment for small Sums , my Loss there too hath been very considerable , and it must be so , when a Lady can borrow a handsom Petticoat , or a clean Gown , and I not have the least Hank upon her !
And , o ' my Conscience , now-a-days most Ladies take a Delight in cheating , when they can do it with Safety .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Madam , you had a handsom Gold Watch of us ` tother Day for seven Guineas .
-- Considering we must have our Profit .
-- To a Gentleman upon the Road , a Gold Watch will be scarce worth the taking .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trapes .
Consider , Mr. Peachum , that Watch was remarkable , and not of very safe Sale .
-- If you have any black Velvet Scarfs -- they are a handsom Winter-wear , and take with most Gentlemen who deal with my Customers .
-- 'T is I that put the Ladies upon a good Foot .
'T is not Youth or Beauty that fixes their Price .
The Gentlemen always pay according to their Dress , from half a Crown to two Guineas ; and yet those Hussies make nothing of bilking of me .
-- Then too , allowing for Accidents .
-- I have eleven fine Customers now down under the Surgeon 's Hands -- what with Fees and other Expenses , there are great Goings-out , and no Comings in , and not a Farthing to pay for at least a Month 's Clothing .
-- We run great Risques -- great Risques indeed .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
As I remember , you said something just now of Mrs. Coaxer .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trapes .
Yes , Sir .
-- To be sure I stript her of a Suit of my own Clothes about two Hours ago ; and have left her as she should be , in her Shift , with a Lover of hers at my House .
She call'd him up Stairs , as he was going to Mary-bone in a Hackney Coach .
-- And I hope , for her own sake and mine , she will persuade the Captain to redeem her , for the Captain is very generous to the Ladies .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
What Captain ?
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trapes .
He thought I did not know him -- An intimate Acquaintance of yours , Mr. Peachum -- Only Captain Macheath -- as fine as a Lord .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
To-morrow , dear Mrs. Dye , you shall set your own Price upon any of the Goods you like -- We have at least half a Dozen Velvet Scarfs , and all at your Service .
Will you give me leave to make you a Present of this Suit of Night-clothes for your own wearing ?
-- But are you sure it is Captain Macheath .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trapes .
Though he thinks I have forgot him ; no body knows him better .
I have taken a great deal of the Captain 's Money in my Time at second-hand , for he always lov'd to have his Ladies well drest .
</p>
<p>
Peachum .
Mr. Lockit and I have a little Business with the Captain ; -- You understand me -- and we will satisfy you for Mrs. Coaxer 's Debt .
</p>
<p>
Lockit .
Depend upon it -- we will deal like Men of Honour .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Trapes .
I do n't enquire after your Affairs -- so whatever happens , I wash my Hands o n't -- It hath always been my Maxim , that one Friend should assist another -- But if you please -- I 'll take one of the Scarfs home with me .

Like the Sailor he holds up his hand , Distrest on the dashing Wave .
To die a dry Death at Land , Is as bad as a watery Grave .
And alas , poor Polly !
Alack , and well-a-day !
Before I was in Love , Oh !
every Month was May .
</p>

When he holds up his Hand arraign'd for his Life , O think of your Daughter , and think I 'm his Wife !
What are Canons , or Bombs , or clashing of Swords ?
For Death is more certain by Witnesses Words .
Then nail up their Lips ; that dread Thunder allay ; And each Month of my Life will hereafter be May .

-- For Death is a Debt , A Debt on Demand .
-- So take what I owe .
Then farewell , my Love -- Dear Charmers , adieu .
Contented I die -- 'T is the better for you .
Here ends all Disputes the rest of our Lives , For this way at once I please all my Wives .

Sure there is nothing so charming as Music !
I 'm fond of it to Distraction !

Since Laws were made for ev'ry Degree , To curb Vice in others , as well as me , I wonder we ha n't better Company , Upon Tyburn Tree !

For my having broke Prison , you see , Gentlemen , I am order'd immediate Execution .
-- The Sheriff 's Officers , I believe , are now at the Door .
-- That Jemmy Twitcher should peach me , I own surpris'd me !
-- 'T is a plain Proof that the World is all alike , and that even our Gang can no more trust one another than other People .
Therefore , I beg you , Gentlemen , look well to yourselves , for in all probability you may live some Months longer .
</p>
<p>
Matt .
We are heartily sorry , Captain , for your Misfortune .
-- But 't is what we must all come to .

Peachum and Lockit , you know , are infamous Scoundrels .
Their Lives are as much in your Power , as yours are in theirs .

Macheath .
My dear Lucy -- My dear Polly -- Whatsoever hath pass'd between us is now at an end -- If you are fond of marrying again , the best Advice I can give you , is to Ship yourselves off for the West-Indies , where you 'll have a fair Chance of getting a Husband a-piece , or by good Luck , two or three , as you like best .

[ Exit Macheath guarded .

To them , Enter Player and Beggar .
</p>
<p>
Player .
But , honest Friend , I hope you do n't intend that Macheath shall be really executed .
</p>
<p>
Beggar .
Most certainly , Sir .
-- To make the Piece perfect , I was for doing strict poetical Justice .
-- Macheath is to be hang'd ; and for the other Personages of the Drama , the Audience must have suppos'd they were all either hang'd or transported .
</p>
<p>
Player .
Why then , Friend , this is a downright deep Tragedy .
The Catastrophe is manifestly wrong , for an Opera must end happily .
</p>
<p>
Beggar .
Your Objection , Sir , is very just , and is easily remov'd .
For you must allow , that in this kind of Drama , 't is no matter how absurdly things are brought about -- So -- you Rabble there -- run and cry , A Reprieve !
-- let the Prisoner be brought back to his Wives in Triumph .
</p>
<p>
Player .
All this we must do , to comply with the Taste of the Town .
</p>
<p>
Beggar .
Through the whole Piece you may observe such a Similitude of Manners in high and low Life , that it is difficult to determine whether ( in the fashionable Vices ) the fine Gentlemen imitate the Gentlemen of the Road , or the Gentlemen of the Road the fine Gentlemen .
-- Had the Play remained , as I at first intended , it would have carried a most excellent Moral .
` Twould have shewn that the lower Sort of People have their Vices in a degree as well as the Rich : And that they are punish'd for them .
</p>
<p>
To them , Macheath with Rabble , &c..
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
So , it seems , I am not left to my Choice , but must have a Wife at last .
-- Look ye , my Dears , we will have no Controversy now .
Let us give this Day to Mirth , and I am sure she who thinks herself my Wife will testify her Joy by a Dance .
</p>
<p>
All .
Come , a Dance -- a Dance .
</p>
<p>
Macheath .
Ladies , I hope you will give me leave to present a Partner to each of you .
And ( if I may without Offence ) for this time , I take Polly for mine .
-- And for Life , you Slut , -- for we were really marry'd .
-- As for the rest .
-- But at present keep your own Secret .

Thus I stand like the Turk , with his Doxies around ; From all Sides their Glances his Passion confound ; For Black , Brown , and Fair , his Inconstancy burns , And the different Beauties subdue him by turns : Each calls forth her Charms to provoke his Desires : Though willing to all , with but one he retires .
But think of this Maxim , and put off your Sorrow , The Wretch of To-day , may be happy To-morrow .
