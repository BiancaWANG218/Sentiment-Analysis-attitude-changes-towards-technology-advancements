It may be necessary to acquaint the reader , that this play is printed exactly as it is acted .
</p>
<p>
I must farther own the assistance I have receiv'd in this piece from two of my friends ; who , tho ' they will not allow me the honour of having their names join'd with mine , can not deprive me of the pleasure of making this acknowledgment .

PROLOGUE
</p>
<p>
Spoke by MR. WILKS .
</p>
<p>
Authors are judg'd by strange capricious rules , The great ones are thought mad , the small ones fools .
Yet sure the best are most severely fated , For fools are only laugh'd at , wits are hated , Blockheads with reason , men of sense abhor ; But fool ` gainst fool is barb ` rous civil war .
Why on all authors then should critics fall ?
Since some have writ , and shewn no wit at all .
Condemn a play of theirs , and they evade it , Cry , damn not us , but damn the French that made it ; By running goods , these graceless owlers gain , Theirs are the rules of France , the plots of Spain : But wit , like wine , from happier climates brought , Dash'd by these rogues , turns English common draught : They pall Moliere 's and Lopez sprightly strain , And teach dull Harlequins to grin in vain .
How shall our author hope a gentle fate , Who dares most impudently -- not translate .
It had been civil in these ticklish times , To fetch his fools and knaves from foreign climes ; Spaniards and French abuse to the worlds ' end But spare old England , lest you hurt a friend .
If any fool is by your satire bit , Let him hiss loud , to show you all -- he 's hit .
Poets make characters as salesmen cloaths , We take no measure of your fops and beaus .
But here all sizes and all shapes ye meet , And fit yourselves -- like chaps in Monmouth-street .
</p>
<p>
Gallants look here , this [ B ] fool 's cap has an air -- Goodly and smart , -- with ears of Issachar .
Let no one fool engross it , or confine : A common blessing !
now 't is your 's , now mine .
But poets in all ages , had the Care To keep this cap , for such as will , to wear ; Our author has it now , for ev'ry wit Of course resign'd it to the next that writ : And thus upon the stage 't is fairly [ C ] thrown , Let him that takes it , wear it for his own .

COMEDY .

<p>
ACT I .
</p>
<p>
Enter FOSSILE , leading TOWNLEY .
</p>
<p>
Fos .
Welcome , my bride , into the habitation of thy husband .
The scruples of the parson --
</p>
<p>
Town .
And the fatigue of the ceremony --
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Are at last well over .
</p>
<p>
Town .
These blank licences are wonderful commodious .
-- The clergy have a noble command , in being rangers of the park of matrimony ; produce but a warrant , and they deliver a lady into your possession : but I have no quarrel with them , since they have put me into so good hands .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
I now proclaim a solemn suspension of arms between medicine and diseases .
Let distempers suspend their malignant influence , and powders , pills , and potions their operations .
Be this day sacred to my love .
I had rather hold this hand of thine , than a dutchess by the pulse .
</p>
<p>
Town .
And I this , than a hand of matadores .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Who knows but your relations may dispute my title to your person ?
come , my dear , the seal of the matrimonial bond is consummation .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Alas !
what will become of me !
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Why are thy eyes fix'd on the ground ?
why so slow ?
and why this trembling ?
</p>
<p>
Town .
Ah !
heedless creature that I was , to quit all my relations , and trust myself alone in the hands of a strange man .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Courage , thou best of my curiosities .
Know that in husband , is comprehended all relations ; in me thou seest a fond father .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Old enough o ' my conscience .
</p>
<p>
[ Aside .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
You may , you must trust yourself with me .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Do with me as you please : Yet sure you can not so soon forget the office of the church .
Marriage is not to be undertaken wantonly , like brute beasts .
If you will transgress , the sin be upon your own head .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Great indeed is thy virtue , and laudable is thy modesty .
Thou art a virgin , and I a philosopher ; but learn , that no animal action , quatenus animal , is unbecoming of either of us .
But hold !
where am I going ?
Prithee , my dear , of what age art thou ?
</p>
<p>
Town .
Almost three and twenty .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
And I almost at my grand climacterick .
What occasion have I for a double-night at these years ?
She may be an Alcmena , but alas !
I am no thunderer .
</p>
<p>
[ Aside
</p>
<p>
Town .
You seem somewhat disturb'd ; I hope you are well , Mr. Fossile .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
What business have I in the bed-chamber , when the symptoms of age are upon me ?
Yet hold , this is the famous corroborative of Crollius ; in this vial are included sons and daughters .
Oh , for a draught of the aqua magnanimitatis for a vehicle !
fifty drops of liquid laudanum for her dose would but just put us upon a par .
Laudanum would settle the present ataxy of her animal spirits , and prevent her being too watchful .
</p>
<p>
[ aside
</p>
<p>
Enter a Servant .
</p>
<p>
Serv .
Sir , your pistachoe-porridge is ready .
</p>
<p>
[ Exit .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Now I think of it , my dear ; Venus , which is in the first degree of Capricorn , does not culminate till ten ; an hour if astrology is not fallible , successful in generation .
</p>
<p>
Town .
I am all obedience , Sir .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
How shall I reward thee for so much Goodness ?
let our wedding as yet be a secret in the family .
In the mean time I 'll introduce my niece Phoebe Clinket to your acquaintance : but alas , the poor girl has a procidence of the pineal gland , which has occasioned a rupture in her understanding .
I took her into my house to regulate my oeconomy ; but instead of puddings , she makes pastorals ; or when she should be raising paste , is raising some ghost in a new tragedy .
In short , my house is haunted by all the underling players , broken booksellers , half-voic'd singing-masters , and disabled dancing-masters in town .
In a former will I had left her my estate ; but I now resolve that heirs of my own begetting shall inherit .
Yonder she comes in her usual occupation .
Let us mark her a while .
</p>
<p>
Enter Clinket and her maid bearing a writing-desk on her back .
Clinket writing , her head dress stain'd with ink , and pens stuck in her hair .
</p>
<p>
Maid .
I had as good carry a raree-show about the streets .
Oh !
how my back akes !
</p>
<p>
Clink .
What are the labours of the back to those of the brain ?
thou scandal to the muses .
I have now lost a thought worth a folio , by thy impertinance .
</p>
<p>
Maid .
Have not I got a crick in my back already , that will make me good for nothing , with lifting your great books ?
</p>
<p>
Clink .
Folio 's , call them , and not great books , thou monster of impropriety : But have patience , and I will remember the three gallery-tickets I promis'd thee at my new tragedy .
</p>
<p>
Maid .
I shall never get my head-cloaths clear-starch'd at this rate .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
Thou destroyer of learning , thou worse than a book-worm ; thou hast put me beyond all patience .
Remember how my lyrick ode bound about a tallow-candle ; thy wrapping up snuff in an epigram ; nay , the unworthy usage of my hymn to Apollo , filthy creature !
read me the last lines I writ upon the deluge , and take care to pronounce them as I taught you .
</p>
<p>
Maid .
</p>
<p>
Swell'd with a dropsy , sickly nature lies , And melting in a diabetes , dies .
</p>
<p>
[ Reads with an affected tone .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
Still without cadence !
</p>
<p>
Maid .
Swell'd with a dropsy --
</p>
<p>
Clink .
Hold .
I conceive --
</p>
<p>
The roaring seas o'er the tall woods have broke , And whales now perch upon the sturdy oak .
</p>
<p>
Roaring ?
stay .
Rumbling , roaring , rustling , no ; raging seas .
</p>
<p>
[ Writing .
</p>
<p>
The raging seas o'er the tall woods have broke , Now perch , thou whale , upon the sturdy oak .
</p>
<p>
Sturdy oak ?
no ; steady , strong , strapping , stiff .
Stiff ?
no , stiff is too short .
</p>
<p>
FOSSILE and TOWNLEY come forward .
</p>
<p>
What feast for fish !
Oh too luxurious treat !
When hungry dolphins feed on butchers meat .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Niece , why niece , niece ?
oh , Melpomene , thou goddess of tragedy , suspend thy influence for a moment , and suffer my niece to give me a rational answer .
This lady is a friend of mine ; her present circumstances oblige her to take sanctuary in my house ; treat her with the utmost civility .
Let the tea-table be made ready .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
Madam , excuse this absence of mind ; my animal spirits had deserted the avenues of my senses , and retired to the recesses of the brain , to contemplate a beautiful idea .
I could not force the vagrant creatures back again into their posts , to move those parts of the body that express civility .
</p>
<p>
Town .
A rare affected creature this !
if I mistake not , flattery will make her an useful tool for my purpose .
</p>
<p>
[ Aside .
</p>
<p>
[ Exeunt Townley , Clinket , and Maid .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Her jewels , her strong box , and all her things left behind !
if her uncle should discover her marriage , he may lay an embargo upon her goods .
-- I 'll send for them .
</p>
<p>
Enter a boy with a letter .
</p>
<p>
Boy .
This is the ho-ho-house .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Child , whom dost thou want ?
</p>
<p>
Boy .
Mistress Townley 's ma-ma-maid .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
What is your business ?
</p>
<p>
Boy .
A l-l-letter .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Who sent this letter ?
</p>
<p>
Boy .
O-o-one .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Give it me , child .
An honest boy .
Give it me , and I 'll deliver it myself .
A very honest boy .
</p>
<p>
Boy .
So .
</p>
<p>
[ Exit boy .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
There are now no more secrets between us .
Man and wife are one .
</p>
<p>
` Madam , either I mistake the encouragement I have had , or I am to be happy to-night .
I hope the same person will compleat her good offices : I stand to articles .
The ring is a fine one ; and I shall have the pleasure of putting it on the first time . '
</p>
<p>
This from your impatient , R. P .
</p>
<p>
In the name of Beelzebub , what is this ?
encouragement !
happy to-night !
same person !
good offices !
whom hast thou married , poor Fossile ?
couldst thou not still divert thyself with the spoils of quarries and coal-pits , thy serpents and thy salamanders , but thou must have a living monster too !
` sdeath !
what a jest shall I be to our club !
is there no rope among my curiosities ?
shall I turn her out of doors , and proclaim my infamy ; or lock her up and bear my misfortunes ?
lock her up !
impossible .
One may shut up volatile spirits , pen up the air , confine bears , lyons and tygers , nay , keep even your gold : but a wanton wife , who can keep ?
</p>
<p>
Enter TOWNLEY .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Mrs. Clinket 's play is to be read this morning at the tea-table : will you come and divert yourself , Sir ?
</p>
<p>
Foss .
No : I want to be alone .
</p>
<p>
Town .
I hope my company is not troublesome already .
I am as yet a bride ; not a wife .
[ sighs . ]
What means this sudden change ?
[ Aside . ]
Consider , Mr. Fossile , you want your natural rest : the bed would refresh you .
Let me sit by you .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
My head akes , and the bed always makes it worse .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Is it hereabouts ?
</p>
<p>
[ rubbing his temples .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Too sure .
</p>
<p>
[ Turns from her .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Why so fretful , Mr. Fossile ?
</p>
<p>
Foss .
No , I 'll dissemble my passion , and pump her .
[ Aside . ]
Excess of joy , my dear , for my good fortune overcomes me .
I am somewhat vertiginous , I can hardly stand .
</p>
<p>
Town .
I hope I was ordain'd for thy support .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
My disorder now begins to dissipate : it was only a little flatulency , occasion'd by something hard of digestion .
But pray , my dear , did your uncle shut you up so close from the conversation of mankind ?
</p>
<p>
Town .
Sarsnet and Shock were my only company .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
A very prudent young woman this Sarsnet ; she was undoubtedly a good and faithful friend in your solitude .
</p>
<p>
Town .
When it was her interest ; but I made no intimacies with my chamber-maid .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
But was there no lover offer'd his service to a lady in distress .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Tongue , be upon thy guard : these questions must be design'd to trap me .
[ Aside . ]
A woman of my condition ca n't well escape importunity .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
What was the name of that disagreeable fellow , who , you told me , teaz'd you so ?
</p>
<p>
Town .
His name ?
I think he had a thousand names .
In one letter he was Myrtillo , in another Corydon , Alexis , and I do n't know what .
</p>
<p>
Enter SARSNET in haste to her mistress : He runs and embraces her with great earnestness .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Dear Mrs. Sarsnet , how am I oblig'd to thee for thy services : thou hast made me happy beyond expression .
-- I shall find another letter upon her .
</p>
<p>
[ Aside .
</p>
<p>
[ He gets his hand into Sarsnet 's pocket , as searching for a letter .
</p>
<p>
[ Whenever Sarsnet goes to whisper her mistress , he gets between them .
</p>
<p>
Enter PTISAN .
</p>
<p>
Ptis .
Mrs. Colloquintida complains still of a dejection of appetite ; she says that the genevre is too cold for her stomach .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Give her a quieting draught ; but let us not interrupt one another .
Good Mr. Ptisan , we are upon business .
</p>
<p>
[ Fossile gets between Sarsnet and Townley .
</p>
<p>
Ptis .
The colonel 's spitting is quite suppress'd .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Give him a quieting draught .
Come to morrow , Mr. Ptisan ; I can see no body till then .
</p>
<p>
Ptis .
Lady Varnish finds no benefit of the waters ; for the pimple on the tip of her nose still continues .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Give her a quieting draught .
</p>
<p>
Ptis .
Mrs. Prudentia 's tympany grows bigger and bigger .
What , no pearl cordial !
must I quiet them all ?
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Give them all quieting draughts , I say , or blister them all , as you please .
Your servant Mr. Ptisan .
</p>
<p>
Ptis .
But then lady Giddy 's vapours .
She calls her chamber-maids nymphs ; for she fancies herself Diana , and her husband Acteon .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
I can attend no patient till to morrow .
Give her a quieting draught , I say .
</p>
<p>
[ Whenever Fossile goes to conduct Ptisan to the door , Sarsnet and Townley attempt to whisper ; Fossile gets between them , and Ptisan takes that opportunity of coming back .
</p>
<p>
Ptis .
Then , sir , there is miss Chitty of the boarding-school has taken in no natural sustenance for this week , but a halfpeny worth of charcoal , and one of her mittens .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Sarsnet , do you wait on Mr Ptisan to the door .
To morrow let my patients know I 'll visit round .
</p>
<p>
[ A knocking at the door .
</p>
<p>
Ptis .
Oh , Sir ; here is a servant of the countess of Hippokekoana .
The emetick has over-wrought and she is in convulsions .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
This is unfortunate .
Then I must go .
Mr. Ptisan , my dear , has some business with me in private .
Retire into my closet a moment , and divert yourself with the pictures .
There lies your way , madam .
</p>
<p>
[ To Sarsnet .
</p>
<p>
[ Exit Townley at one door and Sarsnet at the other .
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ptisan , pray , do you run before , and tell them I am just coming .
</p>
<p>
[ Exit Ptisan .
</p>
<p>
All my distresses come on the neck of one another .
Should this fellow get to my bride before I have bedded her , in a collection of cuckolds , what a rarity should I make !
what shall I do ?
I 'll lock her up .
Lock up my bride ?
my pace and my honour demand it , and it shall be so .
[ Locks the door . ]
Thomas , Thomas !
</p>
<p>
Enter footman .
</p>
<p>
I dream 't last night I was robb'd .
The town is over-run with rogues .
Who knows but the rascal that sent the letter may be now in the house ?
[ Aside . ]
Look up the chimney , search all the dark closets , the coal hole , the flower-pots , and forget not the empty butt in the cellar .
Keep a strict watch at the door , and let no body in till my return .
</p>
<p>
[ Exit footman .
A noise at the closet-door .
</p>
<p>
( within . )
Who 's there ?
-- I 'm lock'd in .
Murder !
fire !
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Dear madam , I beg your pardon .
</p>
<p>
[ Unlocks the door .
Enter TOWNLEY . ]
</p>
<p>
'T is well you call'd .
I am so apt to lock this door ; an action meerly mechanical , not spontaneous .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Your conduct , Mr. Fossile , for this quarter of an hour has been somewhat mysterious .
It has suggested to me what I almost blush to name ; your locking me up , confirms this suspicion .
Pray speak plainly , what has caused this alteration ?
</p>
<p>
[ Fossile shews her the letter .
</p>
<p>
Is this all ?
</p>
<p>
[ Gives him the letter back .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
( reads ) Either I mistake the encouragement I have had .
What encouragement ?
</p>
<p>
Town .
From my uncle , -- if I must be your interpreter .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Or I am to be happy to night .
</p>
<p>
Town .
To be married .
-- If there can be happiness in that state .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
I hope the same person .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Parson .
Only a word mis-pell'd .
-- Here 's jealousy for you !
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Will compleat her good offices .
A she-parson , I find !
</p>
<p>
Town .
He is a Welshman .
And the Welsh always say her instead of his .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
I stand to articles .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Of jointure .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
The ring is a fine one , and I shall have the pleasure of putting it on my self .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Who should put on the wedding-ring but the bridegroom .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
I beseech thee , pardon thy dear husband .
Love and jealousy are often companions , and excess of both had quite obnubilated the eyes of my understanding .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Barbarous man !
I could forgive thee , if thou hadst poison'd my father , debauch'd my sister , kill'd my lapdog ; but to murder my reputation !
</p>
<p>
[ Weeps .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Nay , I beseech thee , forgive me .
</p>
<p>
[ Kneels .
</p>
<p>
Town .
I do : but upon condition your jealous fit never returns .
To a jealous man a whisper is evidence , and a dream demonstration .
A civil letter makes him thoughtful , an innocent visit mad .
I shall try you , Mr. Fossile ; for do n't think I 'll be deny'd company .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Nay , prithee , my dear ; I own I have abused thee .
But lest my marriage , and this simple story should take air in the neighbourhood , to morrow we will retire into the country together , till the secret is blown over .
I am call'd to a patient .
In less than half an hour I 'll be with you again , my dear .
</p>
<p>
[ Exit Fossile .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Plotwell 's letter had like to have ruin'd me .
'T was a neglect in me , not to intrust him with the secret of my marriage .
A jealous bridegroom !
every poison has its antidote ; as credulity is the cause , so it shall be the cure of his jealousy .
To morrow I must be spirited away into the country ; I 'll immediately let Plotwell know of my distress : and this little time with opportunity , even on his wedding-day , shall finish him a compleat husband .
Intrigue assist me !
and I 'll act a revenge that might have been worthy the most celebrated wife in Boccace .
</p>
<p>
Enter PLOTWELL and CLINKET .
</p>
<p>
Hah !
Plotwell !
which way got he hither ?
I must caution him to be upon his guard .
</p>
<p>
Plot .
Madam , I am agreeably surpriz'd to find you here .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Me , Sir ?
you are certainly mistaken , for I do n't remember I ever saw you before .
</p>
<p>
Plot .
Madam , I beg your pardon .
How like a truth sounds a lye from the tongue of a fine woman .
</p>
<p>
[ Aside .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
This , Madam , is Mr. Plotwell ; a Gentleman who is so infinitely obliging , as to introduce my play on the theatre , by fathering the unworthy issue of my muse , at the reading it this morning .
</p>
<p>
Plot .
I should be proud , madam , to be a real father to any of your productions .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
Mighty just .
Ha , ha , ha .
You know , Mr. Plotwell , that both a parrot and a player can utter human sounds , but we allow neither of them to be a judge of wit .
Yet some of those people have had the assurance to deny almost all my performances the privilege of being acted .
Ah !
what a Go√ªt de travers rules the understanding of the illiterate !
</p>
<p>
Plot .
There are some , madam , that nauseate the smell of a rose .
</p>
<p>
[ Whenever Plotwell and Townley endeavour to talk , she interrupts them .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
If this piece be not rais'd to the sublime , let me henceforth be stigmatiz'd as a reptile in the dust of mediocrity .
I am persuaded , Sir , your adopted child will do you no dishonour .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Pray , madam , what is the subject ?
</p>
<p>
Clink .
Oh !
beyond every thing .
So adapted for tragical machines !
so proper to excite the passions !
not in the least encumber'd with episodes !
the vraysemblance and the miraculous are linkt together with such propriety .
</p>
<p>
Town .
But the subject , madam ?
</p>
<p>
Clink .
The universal Deluge , I chose that of Deucalion and Pyrrha , because neither our stage nor actors are hallow'd enough for sacred story .
</p>
<p>
Plot .
But , madam --
</p>
<p>
[ To Townley .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
What just occasion for noble description !
these players are exceeding dilatory .

<p>
Clink .
Imagine Deucalion and Pyrrha in their boat .
They pass by a promontory , where stands prince H√¶mon a former lover of Pyrrah 's , ready to be swallowed up by the devouring flood .
She presses her husband to take him into the boat .
Your part , Sir , is H√¶mon ; the lady personates Pyrrha ; and I represent Deucalion .
To you , Sir .
</p>

Thou seest me now sail'd from my former lodgings , Beneath a husband 's ark ; yet fain I would reward Thy proffer'd love .

</p>
<p>
Clink .
Fye , Mr. Plotwell ; this is against all the decorum of the stage ; I will no more allow the libertinism of lip-embraces than the barbarity of killing on the stage ; your best tragedians , like the ladies of quality in a visit , never turn beyond the back-part of the cheek to a salute , as thus Mr. Plotwell .
</p>
<p>
[ Kisses Plotwell .
</p>
<p>
Plot .
I do n't find in Aristotle any precept against killing .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
Yet I would not stand upon the brink of an indecorum .
</p>
<p>
Plot .
True , madam , the finishing stroke of love and revenge should never shock the eyes of an audience .
But I look upon a kiss in a comedy to be upon a par with a box on the ear in a tragedy , which is frequently given and taken by your best authors .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
Mighty just !
for a lady can no more put up a kiss than a gentleman a box on the ear .
Take my muse , Sir , into your protection [ Gives him her play ] the players I see are here .
Your personating the author will infallibly introduce my play on the stage , and spite of their prejudice , make the theatre ring with applause , and teach even that injudicious Canaille to know their own interest .

PLOTWELL , TOWNLEY , CLINKET , with Sir TREMENDOUS and two Players , discovered seated round a Table .
</p>
<p>
Plot .
Gentlemen , this lady who smiles on my performances , has permitted me to introduce you and my tragedy to her tea-table .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
Gentlemen , you do me honour .
</p>
<p>
1st Play .
Suffer us , Sir , to recommend to your acquaintance , the famous Sir Tremendous , the greatest critick of our age .
</p>
<p>
Plot .
Sir Tremendous , I rejoice at your presence ; though no lady that has an antipathy , so sweats at a cat as some authors at a critick .
Sir Tremendous , madam , is a Gentleman who can instruct the town to dislike what has pleased them , and to be pleased with what they disliked .
</p>
<p>
Sir Trem .
Alas !
what signifies one good palate when the taste of the whole town is viciated .
There is not in all this Sodom of ignorance ten righteous criticks , who do not judge things backward ,
</p>
<p>
Clink .
I perfectly agree with Sir Tremendous : your modern tragedies are such egregious stuff , they neither move terror nor pity .
</p>
<p>
Plot .
Yes , madam , the pity of the audience on the first night , and the terror of the author for the third .
Sir Tremendous 's plays indeed have rais'd a sublimer passion , astonishment .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
I perceive here will be a wit-combat between these beaux-esprits .
Prue , be sure you set down all the similes .
</p>
<p>
Prue retires to the back part of the stage with pen and ink .
</p>
<p>
Sir Trem .
The subjects of most modern plays are as ill chosen as --
</p>
<p>
Plotw .

</p>

</p>
<p>
Sir Trem .
Their plots as shallow --
</p>
<p>
Plotw .
As those of bad poets against new plays

<p>
Sir Trem .

Sir Trem .
Their diction so low , that -- that --

And then their thefts are so open --

Plotw .
that the very French taylors can discover them .
</p>
<p>
Sir Trem .
O what felony from the ancients !
what petty larceny from the moderns !
there is the famous Ephigenia of Racine , he stole his Agamemnon from Seneca , who stole it from Euripides , who stole it from Homer , who stole it from all the ancients before him .
In short there is nothing so execrable as our most taking tragedies .

</p>
<p>
Clink .
Mr. Plotwell , I will not be deny'd the pleasure of reading it , you will pardon me .
</p>
<p>
1st Play .
The deluge !
the subject seems to be too recherche .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
A subject untouch'd either by ancients or moderns , in which are terror and pity in perfection .
</p>
<p>
1st Play .
The stage will never bear it .
Can you suppose , Sir , that a box of ladies will sit three hours to see a rainy day , and a feather in a storm ; make your best of it , I know it can be nothing else .
</p>
<p>
2d Play .
If you please , madam , let us hear how it opens .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
[ reads . ]
The scene opens and discovers the heavens cloudy .
A prodigious shower of rain .
At a distance appears the top of the mountain Parnassus ; all the fields beneath are over-flowed ; there are seen cattle and men swimming .
The tops of steeples rise above the flood , with men and women perching on their weathercocks --
</p>
<p>
Sir Trem .
Begging your pardon , Sir , I believe it can be proved , that weather-cocks are of a modern invention .
Besides , if stones were dissolved , as a late philosopher hath proved , how could steeples stand ?
</p>
<p>
Plot .
I do n't insist upon trifles .
Strike it out .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
Strike it out !
consider what you do .
In this they strike at the very foundation of the drama .
Do n't almost all the persons of your second act start out of stones that Deucalion and Pyrrha threw behind them ?
This cavil is levell'd at the whole system of the reparation of human race .
</p>
<p>
1st Play .
Then the shower is absurd .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
Why should not this gentleman rain , as well as other authors snow and thunder ?
-- -- [ reads . ]
Enter Deucalion in a sort of waterman 's habit , leading his wife Pyrrha to a boat -- Her first distress is about her going back to fetch a casket of jewels .
Mind , how he imitates your great authors .
The first speech has all the fire of Lee .
</p>
<p>
Tho ' heav'n wrings all the sponges of the sky , And pours down clouds , at once each cloud a sea .
Not the spring tides --
</p>
<p>
Sir Trem .
There were no spring tides in the Mediteranean , and consequently Deucalion could not make that simile .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
A man of Deucalion 's quality might have travelled beyond the Mediteranean , and so your objection is answered .
Observe , Sir Tremendous , the tenderness of Otway , in this answer of Pyrrha .
</p>
<p>
-------------------- Why do the stays Taper my waist , but for thy circling arms ?
</p>
<p>

Indeed , madam , with submission , and I think I have some experience of the stage , this play will hardly take .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
The worst lines of it would be sufficiently clapt , if it had been writ by a known author , or recommended by one .
</p>
<p>
Sir Trem .
Between you and I , madam , who understand better things , this gentleman knows nothing of poetry .
</p>
<p>
1st Play .
The gentleman may be an honest man , but he is a damn'd writer , and it neither can take , nor ought to take .
</p>
<p>
Sir Trem .
If you are the gentleman 's friend , and value his reputation , advise him to burn it .

How true is that saying of the philosopher !
` We only know , that we know nothing . '
The eruption of those horns which seem'd to make so strong a push is now suppress'd .
Is the mystery of all these letters nothing but the revenge of a disappointed lover ?
The hand and seal are just the same with the Welchman 's that I intercepted a while ago .
Truly , these Welch are a hot revengeful people .
My wife may be virtuous ; she may not .
Prevention is the safest method with diseases and intrigues .
Women are wanton , husbands weak , bawds busy , opportunities dangerous , gallants eager ; therefore it behoves honest men to be watchful .
But here comes my Wife , I must hide myself ; for should I be detected , she might have a just cause of complaint for my impertinent curiosity .

But for the natural conformity of our constitutions .
Because thou art hot and moist in the third degree , and I myself cold and dry in the first .
</p>
<p>
Town .
And so nature has coupled us like the elements .
</p>
<p>
Fos .
Thou hast nothing to do but to submit thy constitution to my regimen .
</p>
<p>
Town .
You shall find me obedient in all things .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
It is strange , yet certain , that the intellects of the infant depend upon the suppers of the parents .
Diet must be prescrib'd .
</p>
<p>
Town .
So the wit of one 's posterity is determin'd by the choice of one 's cook .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Right .
You may observe how French cooks , with their high ragousts , have contaminated our plain English understandings .
Our supper to night is extracted from the best authors .
How delightful is this minute of tranquility !
my soul is at ease .
How happy shalt thou make me !
thou shalt bring me the finest boy !
</p>
<p>
[ A knocking at the door ,
</p>
<p>
No mortal shall enter these doors this day .
[ knocking again . ]
Oh , it must be the news of poor lady Hippokekoana 's death .
Poor woman !
such is the condition of life , some die , and some are born , and I shall now make some reparation for the mortality of my patients by the fecundity of my wife .
My dear thou shalt bring me the finest boy !
</p>
<p>
Enter footman .
</p>
<p>
Foot .
Sir , here 's a seaman from Deptford must needs speak with you .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Let him come in .
One of my retale Indian merchants , I suppose , that always brings me some odd thing .
</p>
<p>
Enter sailor with a child .
</p>
<p>
What hast thou brought me , friend , a young drill ?
</p>
<p>
Sail .
Look ye d' ye see , master , you know best whether a monkey begot him .
</p>

Foss .
A meer human child .

Thy carelessness , Sarsnet , has exposed me , I am lost and ruin'd .
O heav ` n !

[ Aside .
</p>

Is the child monstrous ?
or dost thou bring him here to take physick ?
</p>
<p>
Sail .
I care not what he takes so you take him .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
What does the fellow mean ?
</p>
<p>
Sail .
Fellow me no fellows .
My name is Jack Capstone of Deptford , and are not you the man that has the raree-show of oyster-shells and pebble-stones ?
</p>
<p>
Fos .
What if I am ?
</p>
<p>
Sail .
Why , then my invoice is right , I must leave my cargo here .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Miserable woman that I am !
how shall I support this fight !
thy bastard brought into thy family as soon as thy bride !
</p>
<p>
Fos .
Patience , patience , I beseech you .
Indeed I have no posterity .
</p>
<p>
Town .
You lascivious brute you .
</p>
<p>
Fos .
Passion is but the tempestuous cloud that obscures reason ; be calm and I 'll convince you .
Friend , how come you to bring the infant hither ?
</p>
<p>
Sail .
My wife , poor woman , could give him suck no longer , for she died yesterday morning .
There 's a long account , master .
It was hard to trace him to the fountain-head .
I steer'd my course from lane to lane , I spoke to twenty old women , and at last was directed to a ribbon-shop in Covent-Garden , and they sent me hither , and so take the bantling and pay me his clearings .
</p>
<p>
[ Offers him the child .
</p>
<p>
Fos .
I shall find law for you , sirrah .
Call my neighbour Possum , he is a justice of peace , as well as a physician .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Call the man back .
If you have committed one folly , do n't expose yourself by a second .
</p>
<p>
Sail .
The gentlewoman says well .
Come , master , we all know that there is no boarding a pretty wench , without charges one way or other ; you are a doctor , master , and have no surgeons bills to pay ; and so can the better afford it .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Rather than you should bring a scandal on your character , I will submit to be a kind mother-in-law .
</p>
<p>
Enter Justice Possum , and Clerk .
</p>
<p>
Fos .
Mr. justice Possum , for now I must so call you , not brother Possum ; here is a troublesome fellow with a child , which he would leave in my house .
</p>
<p>
Pos .
Another man 's child ?
he can not in law .
</p>
<p>
Fos .
It seemeth to me to be a child unlawfully begotten .
</p>
<p>
Pos .
A bastard !
who does he lay it to ?
</p>
<p>
Fos .
To our family .
</p>
<p>
Pos .
Your family , quatenus a family , being a body collective , can not get a bastard .
Is this child a bastard , honest friend ?
</p>
<p>
Sail .
I was neither by when his mother was show'd , nor when she was unladen ; whether he belong to a fair trader , or be run goods , I can not tell : In short here I was sent , and here I will leave him .
</p>
<p>
Pos .
Dost then know his mother , friend ?
</p>
<p>
Sail .
I am no midwife , master ; I did not see him born .
</p>
<p>
Pos .
You had best put up this matter , doctor .
A man of your years , when he has been wanton , can not be too cautious .
</p>
<p>
Fos .
This is all from the purpose .
I was married this morning at seven ; let any man in the least acquainted with the powers of nature , judge whether that human creature could be conceiv'd and brought to maturity in one forenoon .
</p>
<p>
Pos .
This is but talk , doctor Fossile .
It is well for you , though I say it , that you have fallen into the hands of a person , who has study'd the civil and canon law in the point of bastardy .
The child is either yours or not yours .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
My child , Mr. Justice !
</p>
<p>
Pos .
Look ye , doctor Fossile , you confound filiation with legitimation .
Lawyers are of opinion , that filiation is necessary to legitimation , but not √® contra .
</p>
<p>
[ The child cries
</p>
<p>
Foss .
I would not starve any of my own species , get the infant some water-pap .
But Mr. Justice --
</p>
<p>
Pos .
The proofs , I say , doctor , of filiation are five .
Nomination enunciatively pronounc'd , strong presumptions , and circumstantial proofs --
</p>
<p>
Foss .
What is all this to me ?
I tell you I know nothing of the child .
</p>
<p>
Pos .
Signs of paternal piety , similitude of features , and commerce with the mother .
And first of the first , nomination .
Has the doctor ever been heard to call the infant , son ?
</p>
<p>
Town .
He has call'd him child , since he came into this room .
You have indeed , Mr. Fossile .
</p>
<p>
Pos .
Bring hither the doctor 's great bible .
-- Let us examine in the blank leaf whether he be enroll'd among the rest of his children .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
I tell you , I never had any children .
I shall grow distracted , I shall --
</p>
<p>
Pos .
But did you give any orders against registring the child by the name of Fossile ?
</p>
<p>
Foss .
How was it possible ?
</p>
<p>
Pos .
Set down that , clerk .
He did not prohibit the registring the child in his own name .
We our selves have observed one sign of fatherly tenderness ; clerk , set down the water-pap he order'd just now .
Come we may --
</p>
<p>
Foss .
What a jargon is this !
</p>
<p>
Pos .
Come we now , I say , to that which the lawyers call magnum natur√¶ argumentum , similitude of features .
Bring hither the child , friend ; Dr. Fossile , look upon me .
The unequal circle of the infant 's face , somewhat resembles the inequality of the circumference of your countenance ; he has also the vituline or calf-like concavity of the profile of your visage .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Pish .
</p>
<p>
Pos .
And he is somewhat beetle-brow'd , and his nose will rise with time to an equal prominence with the doctor 's .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Indeed he has somewhat of your nose Mr. Fossile .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Ridiculous !
</p>
<p>
Town .
The child is comely .
</p>
<p>
Pos .
Consider the large aperture of his mouth .
</p>
<p>
Sail .
Nay , the tokens are plain enough .
I have the fellow of him at home ; but my wife told me two days ago , that this with the wall-eye and splay-foot belong'd to you , Sir .
</p>
<p>
[ Prue runs a-cross the stage with a letter , which Fossile snatches from her .
</p>
<p>
Fos .
Whither are you going so fast , hussy ?
I will examine every thing within these walls .

` Sir , the child which you father'd is return'd back upon my hands .

` Phoebe Clinket . '

<p>
-- As you say , doctor , the case is too plain ; every circumstance hits .

</p>
<p>
Clink .
'T is very uncivil , Sir , to break open one 's letters .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Would I had not ; and that the contents of it had been a secret to me and all mankind for ever .
Wretched creature , to what a miserable condition has thy poetry reduc'd thee !
</p>
<p>
Clink .
I am not in the least mortified with the accident .
I know it has happen'd to many of the most famous daughters of Apollo ; and to myself several times .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
I am thunderstruck at her impudence !
several times !
</p>
<p>
Clink .
I have had one returned upon my hands every winter for these five years past .
I may perhaps be excell'd by others in judgment and correctness of manners , but for fertility and readiness of conception , I will yield to nobody .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Bless me , whence had she this luxuriant constitution !
</p>
<p>
Pos .
Patience , Sir .
Perhaps the lady may be married .
</p>
<p>
Town .
Tis infamous , Mr. Fossile , to keep her in your house ; yet though you turn her out of doors , use her with some humanity ; I will take care of the child .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
I can find no Deno√ºement of all this conversation .
Where is the crime , I pray , of writing a tragedy ?
I sent it to Drury-Lane house to be acted ; and here it is return'd by the wrong go√πt of the actors .
</p>
<p>
Pos .
This incident has somewhat embarrassed us .
But what mean you here , madam , by this expression ?
Your offspring .
</p>
<p>
Clink .
My tragedy , the offspring of my brain .
One of his majesty 's justices of the peace , and not understand the use of the metaphor !
</p>
<p>
Pos .
Doctor , you have used much artifice , and many demurrers ; but the child must lie at your door at last .
Friend , speak plain what thou knowest of this matter .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Let me relate my story .
This morning , I married this lady , and brought her from her lodgings , at Mrs. Chambers 's , in King-street , Covent-Garden .
</p>
<p>
Sail .
Mrs. Chambers !
To that place I was directed , where liv'd the maid that put the bantling out to be nurs'd by my wife for her lady ; and who she was , 't is none of our business to enquire .
</p>
<p>
Pos .
Dost thou know the name of this maid ?
</p>
<p>
Sail .
Let me consider -- Lutestring .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Sarsnet , thou mean ` st.
</p>
<p>
Sail .
Sarsnet , that 's right .
</p>
<p>
Town .
I 'll turn her out of my house this moment , Filthy creature !
</p>
<p>
Pos .
The evidence is plain .
You have cohabitation with the mother , doctor , currat lex .
And you must keep the child .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Your decree is unjust , Sir , and I 'll seek my remedy at law .
As I never was espoused , I never had carnal knowledge of any woman ; and my wife , Mrs. Susanna Townley , is a pure virgin at this hour for me .
</p>
<p>
Pos .
Susanna Townley !
Susannah Townley !
Look how runs the warrant you drew up this morning .
</p>
<p>
[ Clerk gives him a paper .
</p>
<p>
Madam , a word in private with you .
[ whispers her ] Doctor , my Lord Chief Justice has some business with this lady .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
My Lord Chief Justice business with my wife !
</p>
<p>
Pos .
To be plain with you , doctor Fossile , you have for these three hours entertain'd another man 's wife .
Her husband , lieutenant Bengal , is just returned from the Indies , and this morning took out a warrant from me for an elopement ; it will be more for your credit to part with her privately , than to suffer her publickly to be carried off by a tipstaff .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
Surprizing have been the events of this day ; but this , the strangest of all , settles my future repose .
Let her go -- I have not dishonoured the bed of lieutenant Bengal -- Hark ye friend !
Do you follow her with that badge of her infamy .
</p>
<p>
Pos .
By your favour , doctor , I never reverse my judgment .
The child is yours : for it can not belong to a man who has been three years absent in the East-Indies .
Leave the child .
</p>
<p>
Sail .
I find you are out of humour , master .
So I 'll call to-morrow for his clearings .
</p>
<p>
[ Sailor lays down the child , and exit with Possum , Clerk , and Townley . ]
</p>
<p>
Clink .
Uncle , by this day 's adventure , every one has got something .
Lieutenant Bengal has got his wife again ; you a fine child ; and I a plot for a comedy ; and I 'll this moment set about it .
</p>
<p>
[ Exit Clinket .
</p>
<p>
Foss .
What must be , must be .
[ takes up the child . ]
Fossile , thou didst want posterity : Here behold thou hast it .
A wife thou didst not want ; thou hast none .
But thou art caressing a child that is not thy own .
What then ?
a thousand , and a thousand husbands are doing the same thing this very instant ; and the knowledge of truth is desirable , and makes thy case the better , What signifies whether a man beget his child or not ?
How rediculous is the act itself , said the great emperor Antoninus !
I now look upon myself as a Roman citizen ; it is better that the father should adopt the child , than that the wife should adopt the father .

EPILOGUE .
</p>
<p>
Spoke by Mrs. OLDFIELD .
</p>
<p>
The ancient Epilogue , as criticks write , Was , Clap your hands , excuse us , and good-night .
The modern always was a kind essay To reconcile the audience to the play : More polish'd , we of late have learn'd to fly At parties , treaties , nations , ministry .
Our author more genteelly leaves these brawls To coffee-houses , and to coblers stalls .
His very monsters are of sweet condition , None but the Crocodile 's a politician ; He reaps the blessings of his double nature , And , Trimmer like , can live on land or water : Yet this same monster should be kindly treated , He lik'd a lady 's flesh -- but not to eat it .
</p>
<p>
As for my other spark , my favourite Mummy , His feats were such , smart youths !
as might become ye ; Dead as he seem'd , he had sure signs of life ; His hieroglyphicks pleas'd the doctor 's wife .
</p>
<p>
Whom can our well-bred poetess displease ?
She writ like quality -- with wond ` rous ease : All her offence was harmless want of wit ; Is that a crime ?
-- ye powers , preserve the pit .
</p>
<p>
My doctor too , to give the devil his due , When every creature did his spouse pursue , ( Men sound in living , bury'd flesh , dry'd fish , ) Was e ` en as civil as a wife could wish .
Yet he was somewhat saucy with his viol ; What !
put young maids to that unnat ` ral trial !
So hard a test !
why , if you needs will make it , Faith , let us marry first , -- and then we 'll take it .
</p>
<p>
Who could be angry , though like Fossile teaz'd ?
Consider , in three hours , the man was eas'd .
How many of you are for life beguil'd , And keep as well the mother , as the child !
None but a Tar could be so tender-hearted , To claim a wife that had been three years parted ; Would you do this , my friends ?
-- believe me , never !
When modishly you part -- you part for ever .
</p>
<p>
Join then your voices , be the play excus'd For once , though no one living is abus'd ; To that bright circle that commands our duties , To you superior eighteen-penny beauties , To the lac'd hat and cockard of the pit , { To all , in one word , we our cause submit , { Who think good breeding is a-kin to wit . {
