</p>
<p>
PREFACE .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page"/> WORKS of this kind are in general of so captivating a nature to young readers , that let them run through but a few pages of almost any Novel , and they will feel their affections or curiosity so interested , either in the characters or the events , that it is with difficulty they can be diverted to any other study or <page type="Page vi"/> amusement , till they have got to the end of the story .
</p>
<p>
From the experience then of this species of attraction , such sort of writings may be rendered , by good and ingenious authors , extremely serviceable to morals , and other useful purposes of life - Place the magnet low , and it will degrade our sentiments ; hold it high , and it elevates them .
Imitation is natural to the human mind ; and as we copy those patterns best , which we are most conversant with , it depends upon the choice that <page type="Page vii"/> parents and preceptors make of such compositions , to produce the best effect from this general sympathy .
- Tell me your company , is a just adage ; but tell me your studies is as true a maxim .
</p>
<p>
In the selection of proper pieces to assist toward so pleasing a method of instruction , no inconsiderable part of the attention ought to be paid to the stile and language of the writers ; for it is certain that those who can best express their sentiments , are those who conceive them best ; and the same idea delivered by a gentleman , <page type="Page viii"/> will have double the effect to what it would have if uttered by his valet de chambre .
</p>
<p>
All authors , therefore , of mean or illiberal education , or stationed below the familiar converse of polite life , should be wholly excluded from the sort of library I am here recommending .
Nor should any translations be admitted there , though done from the originals by the best hands , according to the phrase of their title pages - For there is a stiffness in the stile of all the publications of this kind I have <page type="Page ix"/> ever met with , that constrains the ease and freedom of our language , and impures it with a number of Gallicisms , Italianisms , &c. which even those who are allowed to be the best hands , that have ever condescended to so servile an office , find it impossible to avoid .
A work , framed from one 's own ideas , is like learning to write from a copy , a translation is like tracing the letters after the master has penciled them for us .
</p>
<p>
If I have had any success in this , or my former work of the same <page type="Page x"/> kind * , it is owing more to accident than genius , and may therefore be deemed rather fortunate than meritorious .
I have had a good deal of acquaintance with the world , and have known many private memoirs , and particular circumstances in life , which has afforded me an opportunity of supplying both my characters and situations from the living drama , instead of borrowing them from the mimic scene .
I felt , as I wrote , and lived along the line , from the sympathy of friendship , or the tenderness <page type="Page xi"/> of compassion .
This is contagious - I hope my readers may catch the infection also .
</p>
<p>
For I shall think myself extremely happy , if I can , in any degree , contribute towards forming , or informing , the young and innocent ; the task of reforming I leave to greater geniuses , and abler pens .
The characters which present themselves in this work , are , as I have already hinted , mostly drawn from real life , they are therefore natural , and proper objects , either for imitation or avoidance , <page type="Page xii"/>
</p>
<p>
'' Virtuous , and vicious , every man must be ; '' Few in th ' extreme , but all in the degree . ''
But , when writers exceed the bounds of probability , and describe an angel , or a devil , in human form , our reason is shocked , and revolts at the idea of a character so much above , or below , our nature ; the semblance of truth vanishes , the reader 's attention becomes relaxed , and both the events , and the moral , if there should be any ,
</p>
<p>
'' Fade like the baseless fabric of a vision , '' Nor leave a wreck behind ! ''
With such productions our circulating libraries , those slop-shops <page type="Page xiii"/> in literature , abound , and with them must they still be filled , till our legislature shall think proper to enable the booksellers to pay for better works , by passing an act to secure their property , in the copies they purchase : till that is done , no person in the trade can afford to pay a large sum for any manuscript , be the merit of it what it will ; and of course no authors , except the very poor ones , indeed , both in the literal and metaphorical sense of the word , or the rich , who form but a small squadron in the host of writers , <page type="Page xiv"/> will devote their time and labour to the public , without hope of some adequate reward .
</p>
<p>
Those who amongst our legions , neither want , nor abound , have therefore but one way of contributing their mite to the Parnassian treasury ; that of publishing by subscription , which in my estimation is at once both flattering , and humiliating , as it proves the attachment of our friends , while it lays us under the painful necessity of taxing their regard .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page xv"/> Happy and honoured as I have been by the favour of the public in general , as well as by the kind partiality of my particular friends , I shall ever be both proud and pleased to offer my present and future efforts to their indulgent candor , upon any terms , and to subscribe myself their

THE HISTORY OF LADY BARTON .
</p>
<p>
Bangor Ferry .
</p>
<p>
'' Remote , unfriended , melancholy , slow , '' Where mountains rise , and where rude waters flow , '' Where e'er I go , whatever realms I see , '' My heart untravelled , fondly turns to thee . ''
Still to my Fanny turns , with ceaseless pain , '' And drags at each remove , a lengthening chain . ''
HOW much am I indebted to the author of these beautiful lines , for having expressed my present feelings , so much better than I could myself .
The address was originally made to a brother , there can therefore be no impropriety <page type="Page 2"/> in applying them to a sister - and such a one as mine -
</p>
<p>
You desired me , my Fanny , to write to you from every stage - this is the first moment I have had to myself - one of Sir William 's most favourite maxims , is , that women should be treated like state criminals , and utterly debarred the use of pen and ink - he says , that ' `` those who are fond of scribling , are never good for any thing else ; that female friendship is a jest ; and that we only correspond , or converse , with our own sex , for the sake of indulging ourselves in talking of the other . '' '
</p>
<p>
Why , Sir William , why will you discover such illiberal sentiments , to one who has been so lately prevailed upon to <page type="Page 3"/> pronounce those awful words , ' `` love , honor , and obey '' ' !
The fulfilling the two first articles of this solemn engagement , must depend upon yourself , the latter only , rests on me ; and I will most sanctimoniously perform my part of the covenant .
</p>
<p>
Yes , my sister , I will stifle the rising sigh , and wipe away the wayward tear , that steals involuntarily down my cheek , from the fond recollection of those dear friends , that I have left behind me .
Would to nature that the objects necessarily followed their affections , or else retained them with themselves , instead of suffering remembrance , like a tyrant , to pursue the unhappy traveller , adding anxiety to fatigue , and grief to danger .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 4"/> Sir William has met with some gentlemen of his acquaintance , here ; he presented them to me , and I could see that he seemed pleased at that sort of approbation which is expressed by looks , at first sight of a person who happens to please us - there would be something flattering in this idea which I should wish to cherish , if I did not fear that his pleasure arose more from vanity , than affection .
- Yet why should I think so ?
Has he not pursued me with unabated ardour , near two years , and triumphed over the repeated refusals of my friends , and self , by the most obstinate perseverance ?
But might not vanity - be still , thou restless , busy , perturbed spirit !
and no longer seek to investigate an humiliating cause for an event which is irrevocably past !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 5"/> These gentlemen , then , that I told you of , are to join company with us , for the remainder of our journey and voyage : - there is one of them a Lord something , I forgot his title , who is just returned from making the grande tour ; his person is elegant ; I think him , both in face , and figure , vastly like Colonel Stanford .
- I suppose this young nobleman will be the bon ton of this winter , in Dublin ; it may therefore be of some use to a stranger , as I shall be , to be known to him .
I shall not , however , cultivate the present opportunity , as I have left the room , determined not to return , on pretence of a head-ach , in order to tell my dear Fanny what she already knows , that I am her more than sister , her affectionate and faithful friend ,
</p>
<p>
LOUISA BARTON .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 6"/> P.S. Love to my brother , and to my dear Mary Granville ; but I charge you not to shew my letters , even to either of them .
</p>
<p>
Holy-head .
</p>
<p>
WILL you not doubt my veracity , Fanny , when I tell you , that three days spent in this dullest and most disagreeable of villages , have not appeared tedious to me !
There is certainly a wonderful charm in variety of situations - every change produces a new assemblage of ideas ; and actuates the mind with curiosity , comparison , and inquiry .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 7"/> The wildness , or even horror , of this place , for we have had a perpetual storm , is so strongly contrasted with the mild scenes of Cleveland Hall , or indeed any other part of England that I have seen , that one would scarce think it possible for a few days journey to transport us into such extremes , of the sublime and beautiful -
</p>
<p>
I am persuaded that all the inhabitants of Wales must be romantic : - there never was any place appeared so like enchanted ground , and the scenes shift upon you almost as quick as in a pantomime - from the stupendous , bleak , and barren hills of Cambria , you are almost instantly transported into fertile and laughing vallies .
- There never was a richer , and more beautiful view , than <page type="Page 8"/> that of the Vale of Cluyd .
- I am not at at all surprised that poetry took its rise in this part of Britain ; the ancient Druids could not be at a loss for poetic images - every object they saw must have inspired them , and exceeded , both in beauty , and wildness , whatever sportive fancy could have invented , or creative genius drawn forth from the store-house of imagination .
</p>
<p>
I think that even I seem to be possessed with a kind of poetic rapture , while I describe these charming scenes ; but I will not anticipate the pleasure that I hope you will yourself receive from them , next summer ; tho ' I already forestall the much higher delight I shall feel , on seeing my dear Fanny at South-field .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 9"/> Sir William has been in great spirits ever since we have been here ; and highly pleased at a very trifling mark of my obedience : - he proposed riding out , the morning after we came ; and though there was a high wind , and a drizzling rain , I made not the least objection to mounting one of the little Welsh palfreys , and clambering up the hills , at his request - our fellow travellers , Lord Lucan and Colonel Walter , accompanied us .
</p>
<p>
I have described the former to you - the latter is remarkably handsome , but with a peculiar expression in his countenance , which is not the result of his features , but seems to arise from the predominancy of a particular passion in his mind - in short it is that sort of expression , <page type="Page 10"/> which has made you and me dislike so many handsome men .
</p>
<p>
The Colonel is to be our neighbour in the country ; he is now going to Ireland , to take possession of his estate , and a seat in parliament for a borough he never saw - I am no politician , or I should animadvert a little upon this subject .
This self-same Colonel has just tapped at my door , to tell me that the wind veers a little , and that Sir William desires I will hold myself in readiness to embark .
I obey !
adieu , my Fanny .
</p>
<p>
LOUISA BARTON .
</p>
<p>
P.S. I forgot to tell you , that Lord Lucan was at Paris when we were there , last year - he has made me smile , two or <page type="Page 11"/> three times , by his pathetic manner of lamenting his not knowing me then .
I tell him that he may date his acquaintance from what aera he pleases , as our living together in an inn has brought on a greater intimacy , in four days , than almost as many years could have effected , in the usual course of meeting at Operas , Routes , &c..
But he sighs out a rueful , O que non !
and the Colonel laughs , to shew his white teeth , and superior understanding -
</p>
<p>
I come , Sir William !
adieu , adieu -
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 12"/> Dublin .
</p>
<p>
WHAT scenes of distress have I gone thro ' , since I concluded my last letter to my dear Fanny !
We embarked aboard the pacquet-boat , with what they called a shifting gale , and to do the captain justice , he was unwilling to sail .
But Sir William and Colonel Walter were both impatient ; and their impetuosity , as it generally does , triumphed over our calmer reason -
</p>
<p>
We had not been three hours at sea , before there arose so violent a storm , that the captain said it was impossible for the ship to weather it , six hours : he was , however , mistaken , for it continued six <page type="Page 13"/> and thirty - during which time we had been driven upon the northern coast of Ireland , and it was then to be feared that we should beat to pieces , on the rocks .
There was a great number of passengers on board , and their groans and lamentations would have affected me extremely , in any other situation ; but the violent and continued sickness which I suffered , rendered me insensible , even to my own danger ; nor did I feel the smallest emotion when Lord Lucan , who had seldom left my bedside , caught hold of my hand , with a degree of wildness , and pressing it to his lips , said , ' `` We must perish !
- but we shall die , together ! '' '
</p>
<p>
The Captain had fired guns of distress upon our approaching the shore ; and a fishing boat came to our relief , into <page type="Page 14"/> which the passengers crouded so fast , that the gentlemen were obliged to draw their swords , to prevent their sinking it .
How I got into the boat I know not , but I found myself there , rolled up in Lord Lucan 's rocquelaure , and my head supported by Sir William 's knee - there were two other ladies in the boat with us , the youngest of whom , a Miss Leister , seemed to be , if possible , worse than I - but I will not detain you longer in this scene of horror , where we expected to be swallowed up by the waves , that came rolling on us , like moving mountains , every moment , till we reached the shore .
-
</p>
<p>
Behold us then landed upon what may almost be called a desert island , for it is entirely surrounded by an arm <page type="Page 15"/> of the sea , and uninhabited by every thing but a few goats , and some fishermen , who are almost as wild as they .
- It was about four o ' clock in the morning , when we arrived at this dismal place , and such a morning , for darkness , rain , and wind , I never saw !
</p>
<p>
Neither Miss Leister nor I could stand , much less walk , and the gentlemen were obliged to carry us in their arms , by turns , for near two miles - till we arrived at some of the huts , where the hospitable cottagers received us with that sort of surprize , which I imagine we should feel , if an order of higher beings were to descend by miracle to visit us .
- But be their kindness never forgot by me !
and may their beds of straw , and smoaky rafters , yield them <page type="Page 16"/> such soft and balmy sleep , as they afforded to my harrassed frame !
and let them never envy those that toss on down .
</p>
<p>
I did not wake till near ten in the morning , which was then as mild as it had been tempestuous when I retired to rest .
Lord Lucan and Miss Leister were seated on a little bank , without-side the door of the cottage where I slept , to prevent any person from disturbing me ; as soon as they heard me move , Miss Leister came to offer her assistance , in dressing me - she smiling said that breakfast was prepared for me , in a large drawing-room , and under the finest canopy she had ever seen ; then led me by the hand to the bank where she had been sitting - I was surprized to see tea there , which , tho ' made in wooden <page type="Page 17"/> vessels , appeared to me more delicious , than any that I had ever drank out of the finest Dresden china .
-
</p>
<p>
Lord Lucan told me , that Sir William , the rest of the gentlemen , and Mrs. Layton , who is Miss Leister 's aunt , were gone to reconnoitre la carte du paï , de la terre inconnuë , ou nons etions - and that now he had seen me so happily recovered , he wou'd try to join them .
-
</p>
<p>
I found that another boat had arrived from the ship , and that our servants , and a part of our baggage were come - when my poor Benson saw me , she cried for joy ; and indeed nothing but the state of insensibility , in which I quitted the vessel , could have made me leave her behind .
-
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 18"/> Upon enquiring , we were told that there were neither horses or carriages , of any kind , to be had , to convey us out of the island , but that we might cross , in a boat , to a piece of land that lay opposite to one side of it , which , when we reached , was eight miles from any town , or village .
As soon as I had changed my cloaths , Miss Leister and I set out to meet , or overtake , our company ; to confer about the difficulties of our sad situation .
</p>
<p>
I will bring you acquainted with Miss Leisler , in my next letter ; and for the present I will call her Lucy , for I am sure I shall love her , and in that case I hate the formality of Miss -
</p>
<p>
Suppose us now to have walked about a mile and a half , without discovering <page type="Page 19"/> any object but the sea , which surrounded us , when , to our great delight , we spied land , tho ' still divided from us by a gulph we thought impassable .
We stood however on the shore , inventing a thousand impracticable schemes to cross this tremendous Hellespont , but never once thought of the only possible one , tho ' we had been told of it .
We at last grew weary of indulging our visions , and Lucy , who I find is extremely romantic , said , that , were she in my situation , she could , with the utmost pleasure , think of passing her days on the spot we were thrown on ; for that the constant presence of the beloved object , must render any place an Eden to her .
- I told her , that if we were fated to remain there , that either Lord Lucan , or Colonel Walter , would , I hoped , make this spot <page type="Page 20"/> a paradise to her , on her own plan .
She wiped away a starting tear , and said that was impossible .
-
</p>
<p>
At that instant a new object roused our attention ; we perceived a gentleman , well mounted , and attended by a couple of servants , on the opposite shore ; Lucy put up a most fervent ejaculation , that he might have knight-errantry enough to cross the river , and rescue us from our melancholy situation : her prayer was heard - he swam his horse across the flood , and Lucy called him a second Leander !
He came up to us with infinite politeness and address , and told us , that the mail which had been put on shore with us , had been forwarded to his father , who was the next justice of peace , and lived about twelve miles from <page type="Page 21"/> thence ; that by that means he became acquainted with our distress , and had sent his carriage , as far as the roads were passable , with a number of saddle horses , to bring us to his house .
</p>
<p>
I confess I was charmed with this instance of hospitality , and generosity ; I hope I should have been as much pleased with it , had I only heard it related , without having benefited by it .
- There is nothing affects my heart so much as benevolent actions ; I will flatter myself , that this is owing to a natural sympathy .
- We made all the acknowledgments that our joy would permit ; and walked , or rather ran , back to our cottage with the stranger ; where we met our company , and many more of the passengers , who had come in the second boat from the ship .
-
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 22"/> Mr. Mathewes 's servants were by this time come up to us , and opened two large baskets of provisions , cold meats , wine , tea , &c. Every person seemed surprised and overjoyed , while universal gladness diffused itself through our little colony - Lucy appeared almost frantic with delight - the common occurrences of life appear like enchantment to some minds - but there was an elegant simplicity mingled with her transports , that rendered them extremely pleasing .
-
</p>
<p>
I have now , my dearest Fanny , delivered you from the painful anxiety , you must have suffered from the first part of my letter ; my next , I hope , shall transport you to more pleasing scenes .
In the mean time rest assured , that thro ' every <page type="Page 23"/> change of circumstance , or situation , I shall remain unalterably yours ,
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
I long to hear from you : pray tell me , have you heard from the continent ; and how , and where Lord Hume now is ?
</p>
<p>
FOR the present , I will continue my letters journal-wise , as Miss Byron * calls it ; but I can not for my life be circumstantial , and carry you up and down stairs , to the parlour , the drawing-room , the harpsicord , the card-table , &c. &c. &c..
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 24"/> Suppose us then to have crossed the so much dreaded arm of the sea , with some difficulty , and less danger ; that we have performed our twelve miles journey , thro ' rugged roads , and over hills and dales ; and are at last safely arrived at Mr. Mathewes 's very handsome seat , welcomed by him and his lady , and a very numerous family of sons and daughters , grown up to men and women 's estate .
</p>
<p>
On our entrance we were shewn into a room , where there was a table laid with all kinds of breakfasts , that could be pleasing or necessary to the sick , or healthful appetite , and were informed that there were beds prepared for any of the company , who might require rest after their fatigue .
This offer was declined by us all , for the present ; but the <page type="Page 25"/> whole company , which amounted to eighteen ladies and gentlemen , besides servants , accepted Mr. Mathewes 's invitation , to spend that day and night at his house , except Colonel Walter , who said he would go on to Newry , the next great town , and send us carriages from thence .
-
</p>
<p>
From the first notion that you could conceive of our generous hosts , you must believe that we were politely and elegantly entertained ; but neither your idea , nor my description can do justice to their hospitality ; they have given me the most favourable impressions of this country , on my first entering it ; but even Sir William , who is partial to his native land , says I am not to expect a whole nation , of such - fools !
I think he said <page type="Page 26"/> - heigh , ho !
this is my only comment .
-
</p>
<p>
The manners and behaviour of this worthy and amiable family , were expressive of the sincerest pleasure at having had it in their power to relieve our distress - may they or their 's never know any !
Lucy was in raptures with the young ladies ; both she and I flatter ourselves with a prospect of much pleasure , from a future intimacy with Mrs. Mathewes and her daughters .
</p>
<p>
Next morning , our carriages , a coach and four , and several post-chaises , arrived ; and we took a grateful and affectionate leave of our kind hosts .
Our journey had nothing remarkable in it , except Colonel Walter 's waiting for us , at the <page type="Page 27"/> first stage we came to , which , considering the hurry he affected , when he left us , was rather an overstrained piece of politeness , arising I imagine from a supposition that his company was of some consequence to the party .
</p>
<p>
And perhaps he is not mistaken - Lucy 's aunt , Mrs. Layton , a good , agreeable , and well jointured relict , about six and thirty , seems to admire him much - she speaks Italian badly - he is master of the language , and she is for ever applying to him , to correct her pronounciation - who knows but he may find pleasure in instructing so hopeful a pupil .
-
</p>
<p>
The Colonel is what is called a woman 's man : he has lived a good deal <page type="Page 28"/> abroad , and has a superficial knowledge of almost every science - his head may be aptly enough compared to the drawer of a lady 's writing cable , which contains a little of every thing - I have this moment looked into mine , to see if the allusion is just .
Its contents are a miniature picture of Sir William , with a slight crack in the enamel , and the catch that fastens the bracelet broken - my house-keeper 's accounts - a little billet from Lucy - a French song , that the Colonel gave me - some scented sealing wax - writing paper - message cards - and a pocket book , with scissars , penknife , pencil , blank leaves , &c. - I do really think that this farrago of materials , conveys a very expressive image of what I would describe - I hope you will think so too , and henceforward acknowlege the Colonel as an acquaintance .
-
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 29"/> I promised , in my last , to give you a sketch of my Lucy , but I find I am not equal to the task ; for even in her outward appearance there is a variability , that renders it almost impossible to draw an exact resemblance of her ; at some times , you would think that her form and face were designed to personify Vivacity .
-
</p>
<p>
'' Dip in the rainbow , trick her off in air . ''
At other times , a soft melancholy usurps the place of gaiety ; so that , at different aeras , she may pass alternately for a Melpomene , or a Thalia [ Note : The Muses of Tragedy and Comedy . ]
; yet she is agreeable , under both these characters , and I by no means think her temper changeable ; but am rather inclined , tho ' sorry to believe , that these transitions are <page type="Page 30"/> rather the effect of peculiar circumstances , than natural constitution -
</p>
<p>
I know she is in love - but I should suppose that to be rather a consistent passion , where the flame is mutual ; and I should be tempted almost to despise her , or any other woman in the world , who continued still to love , without sympathy - for true love is a passion of that extraordinary nature , as some author has well expressed it , that it requires the felicity of two persons , to render one happy - Without being positively handsome , the men all like her , she has good eyes , hair and teeth ; a lively , tho ' not a fine complexion ; and a form that may justly be stiled elegant , tho ' small .

<p>
And now , my dear Fanny , let me speak of , and to , yourself .
It is above <page type="Page 31"/> a month since I left London ; I have been a fortnight in Dublin , and have not received a single line from you , or any of the other dear friends I parted from in Dover-street !
- They tell me something about contrary winds - for my own peace , I will believe them , but if I am to remain in this island , much longer , under such suspence , I shall be tempted to sell my jewels , and send the money to Lapland , to purchase , I know not whether it is to be an easterly , or a westerly wind - but it shall be a fair gale to waft your letters to me - for the story of Aeolus and Ulysses , you know , is quite an arrant fiction .
</p>
<p>
Your impatient , but truly affectionate LOUISA BARTON .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 32"/> Dover-street .
</p>
<p>
I Received my dear sister 's two letters , from Wales , together ; and am pleased to find that you illustrate your own remark on the good effects which change of objects produce upon our minds .
I have always thought , that in the separation of two persons , who love each other , the one who is left , is by far the greatest sufferer .
The mind , in spite of us , must necessarily , in some degree , accompany , or rather attend upon , the body ; and while that is in motion , it feels a kind of rotation also -
</p>
<p>
'' Beaux , banish beaux ; and coaches , coaches drive . ''
And now I talk of coaches , I have never <page type="Page 33"/> set my foot in ours , since you left London : I begin to think that this is carrying the idea of locality too far , and will therefore order it to set me down at the play-house , this evening .
Your description of South-Britain has encreased my curiosity , but not my desire of travelling through it - for what can augment my wishes to see you !
Your first letter affected me , extremely - Oh !
beware of a propensity to unhappiness , my much loved sister !
Sir William has a roughness in his manner , which I really believe to be more owing to an illiberal education than a coarse mind - I say illiberal , tho ' I know he was bred at a college - learning and science may be there acquired , but alas !
I fear the professors of universities do not attend <page type="Page 34"/> much to les petites morales - There are many men weak enough to imagine that an affectation of contempt for the understandings of women , is proof sufficient of the superiority of their own - but these persons ought never to marry ; for we can neither love those we despise , nor those who seem to despise us - But I am far from imagining this to be Sir William 's case ; I know he both loves and esteems my Louisa , though he be deficient in that sort of galant address , which might better inable him to shew his sentiments - But how few husbands are there , after all , even in what is stiled polite life , who seem to think such an attention necessary ?
I affirm it to be absolutely so - for they must be sad philosophers , indeed , who mistake the possession of a treasure for the enjoyment of it : but I will not <page type="Page 35"/> forgive your trifling with your own happiness , by seeming to doubt a fact , on which alone it can be founded .
</p>
<p>
I am glad you have happened to meet with the gentlemen you mention - Agreeable society is always pleasing to a rational mind , but more particularly so when there is any little difficulty , danger or fatigue , to encounter ; and notwithing your flourishing description of Wales , I can not help thinking that a journey thro ' it must be attended , in some degree , with those slight evils I have mentioned .
-
</p>
<p>
My brother has been remarkably grave , ever since you left us ; but I will not flatter you , by imputing his reserve intirely to your absence - his Delia !
his beloved Miss Colville !
is going to France , <page type="Page 36"/> with her ridiculous mother - and ill used as my sensible brother has been , by that absurd widow , I have no doubt but he will be weak enough to follow her daughter there , and leave poor solitary me to pass the winter , tout seul , in Dover-street .
</p>
<p>
I have told him , and I really believe it , that Mrs. Colville has no exception , either to his person , rank , or fortune , tho ' she will never consent to his marrying her daughter ; but I am persuaded that she would most readily accept of him herself .
- Sir George can not help smiling , when I talk in this strain , tho ' he affects to be displeased , at what he calls my folly .
</p>
<p>
I know you will expect that I should say something of myself .
- Alas , Louisa !
<page type="Page 37"/> my history , like poor Viola 's [ Note : Twelfth Night . ]
is a blank !
I have not received a line from Lord Hume , since I saw you !
my apprehensions for his health and safety , are however relieved , by a letter his sister had from him , dated at Sienna , a few days ago -
</p>
<p>
I will believe , for his sake , as well as my own , that he has written to me - a letter may miscarry ; I have often heard that the posts upon the continent are not so regular , as ours - I will believe any thing , but - that he has forgotten me - Is this philosophy , or vanity ?
and is my opinion of his constancy , founded on his merits , or my own ?
I ask questions without wishing to have them resolved .
<page type="Page 38"/> - Adieu , my only confidante , my much loved sister ,
</p>
<p>
adieu ,
</p>
<p>
F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
P.S. Sir George 's best affections , along with mine , wait on Sir William , and our dear Louisa .
Mary Granville is at Bath , with her aunt .
</p>
<p>
London .
</p>
<p>
WHY surely , my dear Louisa , you intend to publish your travels , and to push Madame de Scuderi from the shelf she has so long usurped in a lady [ ... ] library .
- What a sweet romance is yours !
what hair-breadth ` scapes !
what amazing perils , by sea and by land !
what imminent danger of passing your life on <page type="Page 39"/> a desolate island , which , by the way , would , I fear , had you remained there , have become a dissolute one ; for I do n't find that you had a parson among ye , and I have doubts whether the colonel and the widow would have waited till another shipwreck might have sent you a Jonas - as to Lucy , and Lord Lucan , to be sure they would have remained in a state of perfect purity ; and Sir William and you are already joined in the holy bands of matrimony - So that , upon a fair calculation , I do not think that your community would have been worse than the rest of this habitable globe ; for one couple of delinquents , in three , is as little as can be expected , even in the island of saints , * of which you are happily now become an inhabitant ; or in the territories <page type="Page 40"/> of his holiness the pope , where all should be perfect .
</p>
<p>
But a truce with Badinage , and be assured , my dear sister , that I felt for your distresses ; and sincerely rejoice at your safe arrival in Dublin .
I both love , and admire , tho ' not without a little mixture of envy , your generous hosts .
What extreme pleasure must they have received , from such a noble exercise of their benevolence and hospitality !
</p>
<p>
All girls build castles ; mine have been always situated on a sea-coast , and in them have I often received shipwrecked princesses , and drowning heroes ; I have chafed their temples , and rubbed their hands , for whole hours ; and when my great care and humanity have brought <page type="Page 41"/> them back to this world of woes , they have repaid my pains by a faithful recital of their doleful adventures .
- I once fell in love with a man I never saw , for the same sentiment .
[ Note : Triumvirate , chap .
xciii . ]
- I did not then imagine I should ever have so near and dear a connection as my Louisa , involved in the reality of such a dreadful situation ; and now may heaven be praised for my loved sister 's preservation !
</p>
<p>
I like your description of the Colonel , much - one knows abundance of table drawers , tho ' not all as well furnished as yours - but I do not much like the character - smatterers in science are generally triflers in every thing - that same want of stability which prevents their being master of any art , like a shake in <page type="Page 42"/> marble , runs thro ' the whole block , and lessens the value of every part .
- I should not like such a man , either as a friend , or lover , tho ' he may perhaps be an agreeable acquaintance .
</p>
<p>
I am much more charmed with your Lucy , your little pocket Iris ; I hope she always wears changeable silks , and alters them from grave to gay , according to the complexion of the day - I did not mean to rhyme , as you may see by my mode of writing .
- I agree with you , that those transitions you mention , may possibly be owing rather to particular circumstances , than a peculiar inconsistency of mind - the latter would render her contemptible , the former entitles her to our tenderness and love .
I think , even from the slight account you <page type="Page 43"/> have given of her , there must be a charming frankness in her manner ; which is one of the first qualities I would seek for , in a friend .
Life is not long enough ; but were I an antediluvian , I should not think it worth while to seek for a heart that is wrapped up in a hundred and fifty envelopes - Un coeur serré would disgust me , tho ' the possessor of it had ten thousand amiable qualities .
</p>
<p>
I think that your misfortunes , with regard to the storm , like most other disasters , have been productive of some good , by bringing you acquainted with Miss Leister .
- But what have you done with Lord Lucan ?
when the pencil and pallet were in your hands , why lay them by , without giving a sketch of him ?
I should fancy , from his rueful O que non !
<page type="Page 44"/> that there were traits of character sufficient to mark him by ; - if so , I desire you will resume your new calling , and let me have a full length of his lordship , by the next post .
</p>
<p>
Sir George , as I guessed , actually intends to set out for Paris , in a fortnight .
- I am strongly tempted to accompany him , Louisa - I should then be on the same continent , nay , perhaps , in the same city , with Lord Hume ; for as his route is not absolutely determined , I think it is most likely that he will pass the winter in Paris , as I know it is his favourite city .
- But then - may not my delicacy be wounded , by its being said , or even thought , that I pursued him thither ?
and to what end ?
if his heart , as I much fear , be already estranged , <page type="Page 45"/> will my presence recal it ?
ah , no !
to what then should I expose myself ?
to be slighted by the man I love !
- O , never !
never !
in woods and deserts let me rather dwell , and hide my woes in solitude .
-
</p>
<p>
I now wish I had gone with you to Ireland - and yet I should not chuse to be farther removed from that blessed spot , where ere it be , for at present I know not , that holds my happiness - perhaps my misery !
How can you say , Louisa , that love is a consistent passion ?
alas !
you know it not !
ten thousand contradictory wishes are born and perish in my mind , in the same moment - and yet there was a time , when you , my sister , used to blame my calmness , and upbraid me with having too much philosophy - <page type="Page 46"/> where is that calmness , that philosophy fled to , now !
Oh , let me once more woo them to my breast !
and be what I then was , your happy , as well as affectionate sister ,
</p>
<p>
F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
P.S. .
You will perceive by this long epistle , that I have received both your letters , from Dublin - I do not , my dear , expect two for one ; but the first came last night , when I happened to be out , and the last arrived this morning .
- You may also perceive I began my letter with an affected gayeté de coeur , and ended it in real sadness .
- I had determined not to mention Lord Hume , but my brother 's coming into my dressing-room , and telling me of his going to Paris , threw me off my guard - excuse my weakness , my loved , my dear Louisa .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 47"/> Dublin .
</p>
<p>
INdeed , my dear Fanny , your last letter has hurt me sensibly - I can not express the tender concern I feel for your sufferings - yet with that frankness we both so much admire , I will confess that I am , on this occasion , conscious of the force of Rochfaucault 's selfish maxim , ' `` In the distresses of our best friends , we find something that does not displease us . '' '
Horrid adage !
yet how true !
when I can not help rejoicing that I have never felt the passion of Love , in the extreme that you seem to do - I have ever thought that love , like friendship , could only be founded on <page type="Page 48"/> the amiable qualities of its object , and that with them it must , because it ought , decay .
- How often have you and I laughed at the persevering passion of Miss B - , when we knew that Lord M - despised her ?
- But the little tyrant has taken ample vengeance upon you - Heaven shield me from his resentment !
</p>
<p>
I am , however , far from doubting Lord Hume 's constancy or love to my sweet Fanny ; and my opinion is founded on your charms , rather than his merits - yet grant him to be all you can wish , surely it is a miserable state to have our happiness so totally dependent upon any human being , that our not hearing from them , for a few days or weeks , shall render us totally wretched , and create such a fever in the mind , as you <page type="Page 49"/> describe , and I tremble at !
Heavens !
what a wretch should I be , were I possessed of this tormenting passion .
I am certain Sir William has no more idea of it than of a sixth sense - how would the roughness and asperity of his manners which are now scarce sufferable , then wound me to the heart !
</p>
<p>
Rejoice with me , my Fanny - at what ?
not at my want of sensibility , for sure I think not even you have more - and can I be delighted , then , at not having found in Sir William an object to awaken it !
O , no !
I fear I ought rather to lament than exult , in my present torpid state - but still I have a subject for my tenderness , my much loved , dearest sister !
Come to me , then , my Fanny , and I will soothe your sorrow , will listen <page type="Page 50"/> to your soft complainings , and share each pang that wounds your gentle heart !
</p>
<p>
I was alarmed at the first part of your last letter ; your treating the distresses I went thro ' , ludicrously , was not like my Fanny ; and when we stray so far out of ourselves , there must be some particular cause , which we would wish to conceal , that occasions our acting or speaking out of character - you were unhappy , and did not wish that I should know it ?
But let not even that sort of pious fraud be ever practised between us , more .
- You may write freely , your letters are sacred ; no eye but my own will ever see them .
Sir William is satisfied with our correspondence ; and says , he is sure we shall both be tired of it , in three months - I will venture to say he is mistaken in us both .
-
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 51"/> And so my brother is a stricken deer , also , and is setting off , on a wild-goose chace , after Miss Colville !
surely two victims to love , in one family , are quite sufficient , and don Cupid will , I flatter myself , let the third go free -
</p>
<p>
'' Fantastick tyrant of the am ` rous heart ; '' How hard thy yoke , how cruel is thy dart ! ''
Those ` scape thy anger , who refuse thy sway ; '' And those are punished most , who most obey . ''
For heaven 's sake , Fanny , if you have not by this time received a volume of billet doux from Lord Hume , get up your spirits , break at once into open rebellion against him , and the little purblind deity ; fly to me and try whether an Hibernian swain can not make you amends for his loss .
- I am persuaded that it is possible to shake off an ill placed affection ; but I am afraid by saying so , I may offend you ; however I shall <page type="Page 52"/> let the sentiment pass , since 't is written , and you are welcome to make as free with it as you please ; and perhaps may say , with the philosopher Boyle , ' `` that to undertake the cure of a lover , is perhaps , the next weakness to that of being one . '' '
</p>
<p>
I perceive myself falling into the very error which I reprehend in you , that of affecting to treat your distresses lightly ; but believe me , my Fanny , that I lay a restraint on myself , in doing so , and feel them not the less .
- Chearfulness and dissipation are the only remedies for a wounded mind , and if I can make you smile , even at my folly , my end will be answered .
</p>
<p>
You will , I dare say , discover that this letter has been written at different <page type="Page 53"/> aeras - morning visitors are a pest that rages in all cities ; but is , I think , more violent , here , than in any place I ever was in , except Bath .
- There is some excuse for this intemperate desire of gadding , there , as the use of the waters forbids all sedentaty amusements ; and a game of , Neighbour , I 'm come to torment you , may be conducive to health - but here , without temptation or excuse , the ladies make it a rule to pass their mornings in any one 's house but their own ; and would almost persuade one that they can neither read , write , work , houswife , or pray .
-
</p>
<p>
Exclusive of this grand mal , I like the people and country extremely - there is an air of freedom , chearfulness and affability that runs thro ' all the better <page type="Page 54"/> sort of men and women , and inclines you to like them , even at first sight .
Rien qui gene , rien serré - we may be allowed to speak of a people in this language , who seem to resemble the French more than any of their nearer neighbours .
- The old Irish families stile themselves Milesians , from Milesius , a Spaniard , who brought over a colony of his countrymen to people the island .
- But I should think , from their manners , as I hinted at before , that they were originally derived rather from the French - I hate all national reflections ; but they seem not to have any thing of the Spanish character among them .
</p>
<p>
The court , which is called the Castle , here , is extremely agreeable , as well as brilliant , both in beauty , and finery - <page type="Page 55"/> it abounds particularly with the former - I think I never saw so many handsome women together in any place , as I have seen here , on a ball night .
- Beauty is not , however , so general in this kingdom as in England : it is chiefly confined to the higher ranks of life ; while there I have observed that it was most frequently met with in the middling and lower classes .
-
</p>
<p>
I have run this letter into such an extravagant length , that tho ' I am very well inclined to proceed in the picturesque stile , and give you an idea of lord Lucan , en gros , which is certainly as much as I can venture to pretend to , at present , I find my paper has circumscribed me within the limits of the smallest miniature ; and as my art can not yet rise to <page type="Page 56"/> the nicer touches requisite to that small scale , I shall begin his portrait on a new sheet , next post : in the mean time , this will barely allow me to assure you that my affection and tenderness are , if possible , encreased by the unhappiness of my ever dear Fanny .
</p>
<p>
LOUISA BARTON .
</p>
<p>
Miss Leister is highly pleased , with the title you have given her ; and says she will charge all her poetic swains to celebrate her , henceforward , by the name of Iris .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 57"/> MY dear Louisa 's agreeable melange gave me infinite pleasure , as I am very certain it is an exact representation of her soft yet lively mind .
- I am sorry the gloomy picture I sent of my own , affected you even transiently .
- Lovers , my dear , are a strange inconsistent race of mortals ; their pains and pleasures so totally dependant upon trifling accidents , and yet so exquisite , that they are scarcely to be considered as rational beings .
- You , who are not of the sighing tribe , will be amazed when I tell you , that at the time I received the effusions of your sympathetic tenderness , I had almost forgotten the source <page type="Page 58"/> of my own distress , and could have cried out , with Orestes , ' `` I never was unhappy . ''
- '
</p>
<p>
After this , I think I need not tell you that I had just then received a letter from Lord Hume .
He is well , and kind , my sister !
but , alas !
he talks of spending three years on his tour .
- We are both young , 't is certain ; but three years are three centuries , in a lover 's calendar - and should he hold his purpose I should fancy myself old as a Sybil , or as Cybele , before that time may elapse .
-
</p>
<p>
Tho ' I detest the maxim you have quoted from Rochfoucault , I do not blame you for rejoicing in your own ease and tranquility ; but you surely might <page type="Page 59"/> do so , though I were not in love - and yet , perhaps , the idea of your own felicity would not have struck you so strongly , if you had not then thought me miserable !
They say it is in sickness that health is only valued ; I fear there is a certain perverseness in human nature , that enhances the value of every blessing , from the privation of it - I had conceived an idea , here , but fear I have not sufficiently expressed it ; but what I mean , is that as a friend is a second self , you have had the happy occasion of comparing the good and ill together , without the sad experience of the latter .
</p>
<p>
You see I am becoming a philosopher again - but alas , Louisa !
my philosophy is literally the sport of chance ; for I confess that the only happiness I am at present <page type="Page 60"/> capable of enjoying , is absolutely dependant on winds , tides , post-boys , and a thousand other wayward contingencies !
</p>
<p>
I very sincerely join with you in wishing , since you have not yet , that you may never feel the passion of love , in an extreme degree ; for I am firmly persuaded , that it does not contribute much to the happiness of the female world - and yet , Louisa , I will frankly tell you , that I am extremely grieved at some hints you have dropped , in your letters , which speak a want of affection for Sir William .
- It is dangerous to sport with such sentiments ; you should not suffer them to dwell even upon your own mind , much less express them to others - we ought not be too strict in analyzing the characters of those we wish to love - <page type="Page 61"/> if we once come to habituate ourselves to thinking of their faults , it insensibly lessens the person in our esteem , and saps the foundation of our happiness , with our love .
-
</p>
<p>
I am perfectly convinced that you have fallen into this error , from want of reflection , and through what is called une maniere de parler ; for I will not suppose that my Louisa , tho ' persuaded by her friends and solicited most earnestly by Sir William , gave him her hand without feeling in her heart that preference for his person , and esteem for his character , which is the surest basis for a permanent and tender affection .
-
</p>
<p>
I almost condemn myself for the severity of this stricture ; but my Louisa 's <page type="Page 62"/> happiness , is of too much consequence to mine , to pass over an error that may destroy it , unnoticed , before she is aware .
We are all wiser for others than ourselves , but let this pretence to sagacity be pardoned by an elder sister , as proceeding from the tenderest affection of her 's ,
</p>
<p>
most truly , F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
P.S. Sir George holds his purpose , and sets out , in two days - I shall not accompany him , nor can I at present accept of your kind and soothing invitation ; I mean that in the first part of your letter .
- I abominate your volatile idea of an Hibernian , or any other swain , as a remedy for hapless love - Adieu , my Louisa , and forgive me the matronly airs I have <page type="Page 63"/> assumed in this letter ; for I shall think myself extremely happy , if , in the future correspondence of our lives , I do not make you more than amends , by affording you , in your turn , many opportunities of appearing as much wiser than I , as you are in reality .
-
</p>
<p>
INDEED , my Fanny , I rejoice in your happiness , tho ' I can not help feeling that I am a sufferer by it ; for if you had not received a very kind letter from Lord Hume , you would not , in all probability , have had spirits sufficient to have written an unkind one to me .
- You are , my dear sister , perfectly acquainted <page type="Page 64"/> with every sentiment of my heart , therefore to repeat what you already know , is needless .
But in my own justification I must hold up a portrait to your view , which , from a very short absence , you seem to have forgotten .
</p>
<p>
By the loss of the best of parents , I became my own mistress , before I was seventeen - my brother , who is three years elder than I , was then returned from the university , and set out almost immediately on his travels .
I then looked up to him as the sole stay , both of your youth and mine ; and tho ' my father 's indulgence had rendered us all independent of each other , I firmly resolved never to marry , without the consent and approbation of Sir George .
-
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 65"/> Young as you were you may remember that during the time we passed at my aunt Marriot 's , in Wiltshire , there were several proposals of marriage made to me ; and among the rest Sir William offered me his hand ; but as my heart was by no means engaged by any of the persons who honoured me with their addresses , I adhered to my first plan , and referred them all to my brother 's decision - as there had been no time fixed for Sir George 's return , most of those who called themselves my lovers , withdrew - but Sir William , either more enamoured , or more artful , than the rest , set out immediately for Naples , where my brother then was , and by conciliating his esteem , obtained his consent , which he pretended was all that was wanting to complete his happiness .
-
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 66"/> When my brother wrote to us to meet him at Paris , I was transported at the thoughts of seeing him , after a two years absence , but did not once reflect upon his motive for sending for us , nor did I even know that Sir William Barton was to be one of the party .
- Sir William 's galantry in coming from Paris to meet us at Dover , flattered my vanity , I will c [ ... ] nfess ; the continuance of his assiduities , during our stay in France , confirmed my brother 's opinion of his passion for me .
- But alas !
I was still incapable of making any other return to his attentions , than what mere politeness exacted from me .
</p>
<p>
How often have my brother , Sir William , and you , seemed to doubt my sincerity , when I have declared I knew not <page type="Page 67"/> what love was !
and , O !
how fatal has that inexperience been to my peace , since !
Yes , Fanny , your sister is a wretch !
and gave away her hand , before she knew she had a heart to transfer .
-
</p>
<p>
Yet this I am convinced of , that had Sir William persevered , perhaps a few months longer , in wishing still to obtain that heart , it might , I doubt not , have been all his own .
But can it now bestow itself unsought , and trembling yield to harshness , and unkindness ?
Impossible !
The little rebel owns as yet no lord , and it may breck , but it will never bow , beneath a tyrant 's frown !
</p>
<p>
There never was any person 's behaviour so altered as Sir William 's .
- I perceived a visible change in his manners , <page type="Page 68"/> before we left London ; but it has gone on in a blessed gradation , ever since , and is at length arrived at the ne plus ultra of matrimonial disgust .
- I shall tell you a short story by way of instancing the uncouthness of my present situation , with regard to him .
- Sir William is naturally humane , at least he used to seem so - I was applied to by a wretched family , tenants of his own , who had lost their intire substance by fire - I immediately took ten guineas out of my purse , to pay my charity , when he , with the most supercilious air imaginable , took hold of my hand , bid me put up my money , and not meddle with matters that I did not understand - said I was rather too young for a Lady Bountiful yet ; and that if I went on at that rate , they would fire every cottage on his lands , and he <page type="Page 69"/> should be run into a goal by my generosity .
I stood amazed at this harangue - however I obeyed my husband , by putting up the money , but made Benson convey it to the poor sufferers , as from a third person ; while they with transports of gratitude , acknowleged their having received twenty pounds from Sir William , tho ' forbidden to reveal his bounty to his steward , or any of his family , on pain of his displeasure !
</p>
<p>
Now , pr ` ythee tell me , Fanny , if you do not consider this as an instance of a peculiar sort of perverseness ?
Why should he wish to restrain me from the virtuous pleasure of bestowing charity ?
or endeavour to persuade me that he was totally devoid of it himself ?
Chide me no longer , my sister , for what is much more <page type="Page 70"/> my misfortune , than my fault - and what a misfortune , at my time of life , to look forward to a length of years that must necessarily pass away ,
</p>
<p>
'' Joyless , loveless , unindeared ! ''
May you be happier far !
dissipation must now be my resource ; 't is all that I have left - what a slight and worthless counterpoise for domestic felicity !
I will change the subject .
We are to spend the Christmas at Southfield - Lord Lucan , Colonel Walter , and my Lucy , are to accompany us - next to yourself , she is the most agreeable companion I could have met with - her mind is as delicate as her form - and I can see that she is frequently hurt at the roughness of Sir William 's manners , tho ' <page type="Page 71"/> she takes infinite pains to conceal her feelings from me , on such occasions .
- I once wished that Colonel Walter would have fallen in love with her , that I might have had the happiness of her living near me in the country , but I am now convinced that they were not formed to make each other happy ; and that she woud have refused him , had he been an emperor .
</p>
<p>
She has made me her confidante - she loves , and is beloved , by one of the most charming men in the world ; yet the odds are many against their ever being united .
- I often tell her I envy her situation ; for surely there is something infinitely delightful in suffering for , or with , an amiable person whom we love - it almost equals the happiness of sharing their good fortune !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 72"/> I am sorry I did not sketch out Lord Lucan 's portrait , while I was in the vein ; but he is now so much altered , that my former idea of him would bear no resemblance to what he appears at present .
- From the extreme of gaiety , he is fallen into a profound gravity , and sometimes appears gloomy and distrait - It is impossible to account for this change , as he is much liked and admired by every one who knows him ; and I can not conceive him to be in love , as he is hardly ever absent from our coterie , and I have never observed the least particularity in his behaviour or address to any member of it , tho ' there are a number of pretty and agreeable women in our circle .
</p>
<p>
The Colonel perceives the alteration , as well as I , and seems to hint as if his <page type="Page 73"/> sagacity could discover the cause of it ; but I have never given him the least encouragement to reveal his friend 's secret , and I almost hate him for affecting to triumph over him .
- I have another reason for disliking the Colonel , which I will not at present communicate , even to you - he continues to court Mrs. Layton , but I will not take upon me to say they will be married ; tho ' I am sure it would make her very miserable to doubt it .
</p>
<p>
There is an orphan niece of Sir William 's , a very lovely girl , at a boarding school here - I have endeavoured to prevail on him , to let her live with us .
- She is near fifteen , which , in my mind , renders her present situation extremely improper ; and indeed I have a particular dislike to a boarding-school education , for <page type="Page 74"/> girls , at any age ; as they must necessarily contract from it two qualities that I detest , formality and insincerity .
- Harriet Westly has just written to her uncle , to second my request ; and he has complied with it , tho ' in his ungracious manner , by adding an observation , by way of codicil to his consent , ' `` That two women in a house , are two too many . ''
- '
</p>
<p>
Perhaps Sir William only meant to be witty , and not ill-natured - a play upon words is apt to dazzle those who can not play with them - I am glad Colonel Walter was not by , when this ingenious remark was made , as he seems to take a particular pleasure in repeating Sir William 's bon mots .

<page type="Page 75"/> As the scene I am engaged in is not extremely active , my dear Fanny must be contented with letting me fill my paper with such trivial and domestic occurrences , as may arise from day to day ; nor must she expect order or connection , in any of my letters - I write at every leisure moment , and am perhaps interrupted ten times in the filling of a page .
- You are very differently situated ; mistress of your leisure , and yourself , and I can not forgive your barely mentioning events , in which you know I am extremely interested , as they relate to a brother , and a sister , whom I can never cease to love ; and therefore I can readily pardon your reprehending the weakness , the indiscretion - call it any thing but a fault , of your affectionate

LOUISA BARTON .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 76"/> P.S. I know not whether I told you before , that Lord Hume and Lord Lucan are intimately acquainted .
</p>
<p>
BELIEVE me , my ever dear Louisa , when I tell you that my heart feels , at this moment , the tenderest sympathy with yours , and most truly resents the unhappiness of your situation .
I will chide no more , my sister , but henceforward endeavour to sooth those sorrows , which I can not cure .
- Dissipation , as you say , must be your course : any thing is better than brooding over irremediable evils ; yet great are the hazards which a young and beautiful married woman has <page type="Page 77"/> to run , who enters too deeply into a life of gaiety - the grave part of the world will censure her conduct , as arising from the levity of her mind ; and the dissolute will form schemes for the destruction of that innocence , which is the only true foundation and support of chearfulness , or vivacity .
-
</p>
<p>
Beware of artful men , my dear sister !
I can not help it , I will tell you all my sears ; they may be , nay I hope they are , quite vain .
But I will confess I do not like your intimacy , either with Lord Lucan , or Colonel Walter - I am persuaded that you have not the least apprehension from your connection with them , but remember , Louisa , ' `` The dangers that we see , are easily prevented ; but those strike surest that come unexpected , <page type="Page 78"/> like lightning , which we view , and feel at once . ''
- '
</p>
<p>
I am much pleased that Sir William 's niece is to live with you ; there is a something flattering , even to virtue , in having a constant witness to approve our conduct ; at least I think we should be more at ease , more self-assured , in any trial , with a companion , than when left alone - ' `` Not that I think my sister so to seek ; or so unprincipled in virtue 's book , '' ' to need a guard , save her own purity .
-
</p>
<p>
I remember poor Sterne used to say , that all the mischief which was done in this great city , was brought about by morning tête-a-têtes - which must be unavoidable , without a female inmate , and she should always be a near relation - On <page type="Page 79"/> this principle I think you extremely lucky in having Miss Westly for an eleve - as her presence will be a perpetual guard against another danger you have to fear , the envenomed tongue of Slander .
-
</p>
<p>
The house is an uproar !
what can be the matter !
Sir George is returned - I fly to him .
-
</p>
<p>
O Louisa !
my heart is in rent in pieces ; I have seen my brother almost distracted , his manly face bedewed with flowing tears !
Miss Colville is dead !
she died at Amiens , of a three days fever - my brother met her hearse at Dover - I fear , Louisa , he will never recover this sad stroke .
- Sweet Delia !
I may say with the Queen , in Hamlet , - ' `` I thought thy <page type="Page 80"/> bride-bed to have decked , sweet maid , and not have strewed thy grave ! '' '
</p>
<p>
I can not write more , my tears blind me - you know that I most truly loved this dear departed saint !
her brutal mother is gone on to Paris : would she and her whole race had perished in her stead !
- My brother 's bell rings , adieu , adieu , my sister .
</p>
<p>
F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
MY dearest Fanny , your letter has affected me more than I can express ; I am indeed most truly grieved for my brother , for the sweet Delia , and yourself - yet why lament for her , whose <page type="Page 81"/> state I envy !
her life was innocence ; her death was [ ... ] arly !
would mine had been so too .
- Young as she was , she yet had tasted sorrow ; her mother 's cruelty in first accepting Sir George 's proposals for her , and then rejecting him without a cause , preyed on her tender heart : she loved him , Fanny !
and he deserved her passion - her death has sealed his constancy ; her merits , nay her beauties , are graved upon his heart , in their full lustre : they will remain for ever undiminish'd in his memory , and bloom before him from the silent tomb !
My dearest brother !
how my heart bleeds for thine !
</p>
<p>
I would write to him , Fanny , but fear to encrease his grief , by mentioning the cause - you will be watchful over his distress , till time 's lenient power shall <page type="Page 82"/> blunt the arrows of disastrous love , and soften its sharp pangs to gentle melancholy !
why am I not with you , to share this tender office !
alas !
why am I not any where , but where I am !
</p>
<p>
O , my sister ! '
`` I could a tale unfold '' ' - but I will not add to your present distress , nor take off your attention from that dear brother , to whom it may be useful , to bestow it on one to whom it can not be of service , but who will ever be with the tenderest affection to Sir George , and you , a faithful
</p>
<p>
friend and sister .
LOUISA BARTON .
</p>
<p>
P.S. .
As soon as my spirits will permit , I shall reply to the first part of your <page type="Page 83"/> last letter - I will not now , my Fanny , insist on regular answers , as I am sure you will devote every moment of your time , to our dear mourner .
But if any extraordinary particular , relative to poor Delia , shoud come to your knowledge , pray acquaint me with it .
</p>
<p>
I Now sit down to thank my dearest Fanny , for the kind caution she gave me , in the first part of her last letter ; I will try if possible to forget the melancholy conclusion of it , and reply only to what relates to myself .
- I have had Harriet Westley with me , for some days , and find as much comfort in her innocent and chearful society , as my unhappy <page type="Page 84"/> situation will admit .
But , alas !
she is incapable of administering either consolation or advice to me ; her knowledge of the world is even less than mine ; nor would I , for that world , render her wretched , by reposing the distresses of my perturbated mind , in her soft bosom .
- O , Fanny !
there is neither friend nor confidante for a married woman , who does not find them both in her husband !
</p>
<p>
I am almost afraid to communicate my thoughts to you ; yet why ?
for they are innocent - but letters may miscarry , a thousand accidents bring them to light , and oft undo the peace of the poor writer - but I have nought to lose , my peace is fled !
your apprehensions are but too well sounded , I am in the most imminent <page type="Page 85"/> danger from my acquaintance with Colonel Walter - but , as Isabella says , ' `` Danger , Claudio !
't is here and every where our forced companion ; the rising and the setting sun beholds us environed with it : our whole life 's a journey ending in certain ruin . '' '
Woud mine were come to the last stage !
</p>
<p>
I told you before , that Lord Lucan was extremely altered , from gay to grave ; and that Colonel Walter affected to know the cause of this sudden transition , and repeatedly offered to acquaint me with it , which I constantly declined , and turned it off with raillery -
</p>
<p>
I will confess to you that I before suspected what the Colonel meant to inform me of .
Women are generally too quick sighted , <page type="Page 86"/> in these matters , and I by no means wished to have my doubts upon this subject confirmed .
I observed that whenever Lord Lucan was present , the Colonel used to strive to sit as near me as possible , and frequently whisper nothing in my ear , then laugh as if he had said something smart and lively : I have often looked grave , and sometimes silly , on these occasions , but could not divine the meaning of this absurd behaviour , till this morning .
-
</p>
<p>
I was at work in my dressing-room , and Harriet reading to me , when Lucy came in - I could visibly discover that something had affected or ruffled her mind , and therefore made a pretence to send Harriet out of the room .
- As soon as she was gone , Lucy burst into tears , <page type="Page 87"/> and drew a letter out of her pocket , which she had just received from Colonel Walter ; she made a thousand apologies for putting it into my hands , but said she knew not how to act , upon so nice and critical an occasion - the contents were as follow .
</p>
<p>
To Miss LEISTER .
</p>
<p>
Dear Madam ,
</p>
<p>
THE friendship you profess for Lady Barton , of which I can no more doubt the sincerity , than my own to you , inclines me to acquaint her , through such a proper medium , of an affair which I think of some consequence to her , but of which she at present seems wilfully ignorant ; through I dare say you , and every other person who knows her , except Sir William , have long seen the ardent passion which Lord Lucan has conceived for her .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 88"/> Now really , my dear Lucy , it is a thousand pities that such a fine young man should waste his life in sighs and groans , for a perverse beauty , who will not even deign to own that she perceives his passion .
We all know it is impossible that she can love her husband , and in that case , it is highly propable that she should love somebody else , and why not her poor sighing swain ?
</p>
<p>
I have tried every possible means to prevail on Lord Lucan to avow his passion , but the simpleton denies it , even to me , though he must be sensible that I have seen its rise and progress , from the first moment he beheld her , at Pangor Ferry , to this present writing - I have even attempted to make him jealous , by an affected familiarity with Lady <page type="Page 89"/> Barton , though both she , and you know , que mon coeur est devoüe a madame votre tante - but all this I 'll swear I did in pure good will , in hopes of bringing the lovers to an explanation , which might possibly prevent their going on at the absurd rate they do , at present .
- You know , my dear Lucy , that I have a very high opinion of Lady Barton , I therefore could not presume to mention Lord Lucan as a lover for her ladyship , if I were not perfectly convinced that he is as true a Platonic , as she , or even your little romantic self .
-
</p>
<p>
I would not , by any means , have you venture to shew her this letter ; but you ladies have a thousand agreeable ways of conveying a secret to each other , especially where you have reason to imagine , <page type="Page 90"/> that the information will not be displeasing .
</p>
<p>
I shall have the honour of seeing you , this evening , at Mrs. Layton 's ; but pray do n't take notice of this letter to her , or to any other person , but the one whom it concerns .
- Adio , mia bella , e buona figliuola .
-
</p>
<p>
J. WALTER .
</p>
<p>
I shall never be able to describe what I felt upon reading this detestable scroll !
this outrage to honour , delicacy , friendship , virtue !
But how to act !
it was impossible to think of shewing such a letter to a husband , as the consequences must , in all probability , and ought to have been fatal .
- And neither Lucy , nor I , could submit to the meanness of telling a falsehood , by saying she had not shewn me the letter .
-
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 91"/> In this dilemma , I determined on sending for Colonel Walter , myself , to speak my sentiments to him , upon the occasion ; which I did .
- He came , and on my asking him what I had ever done to provoke his malice , or how he dared to insult me , by his letter to Miss Leister ?
he burst into an affected laugh , and said he was sorry to find that English Ladies had no idea of a jest ; that he really meant nothing more than a little badinage , and to bring about a kind of Platonic galantry , between Lord Lucan and me , which might serve to amuse us in the long evenings we were to pass together at Southfield : but if his raillery had given me a moment 's pain , he asked my pardon , and promised never to offend again on the same subject .
-
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 92"/> I was , in prudence , obliged to acquiesce with this insincere submission ; but from this hour I know him for mine enemy - O Fanny !
what a situation is mine !
would to heaven I could exchange it , for that of our dear departed Delia - she is at peace , my sister - while I - But let me not distress you farther - tell me , I conjure you , tell me , that my brother 's virtue and philosophy have calmed his sorrows , and that he now only feels that sort of tender regret , which arises from the fond idea of a long absent friend .
- Tell me something of yourself ; but let that something give me leave to hope , that you are happy , and I shall repine the less at my own wretchedness - My true love waits on Sir George , and you .
Adieu , my Fanny .
</p>
<p>
LOUISA BARTON .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 93"/> MY dear Louisa , I have received both your letters , and really think no situation can be more difficult than yours ; but as you see the precipice before you , I will trust in that good Providence which is the guardian and support of innocence , that he will enable you to avoid it .
- I am persuaded I felt as much resentment as yourself , on reading Colonel Walter 's letter : I perfectly approve of your not shewing it to Sir William ; but I can not by any means divine what could be the motive for writing it .
-
</p>
<p>
Ever since you mentioned the change in Lord Lucan 's behaviour , I have had <page type="Page 94"/> some apprehensions of his passion for you , but would not hint them , for fear of giving you uneasiness .
- O , my Louisa !
how nicely circumspect must your conduct be , if you mean to escape the dangers that surround you !
and how much brighter than gold , seven times tried in the furnace , will that conduct appear , when it has passed through more than a trial ordeal , unsullied , and unhurt !
-
</p>
<p>
You have never given me the least reason to apprehend that Sir William is inclinable to jealousy : this is certainly a very fortunate circumstance , in your present situation ; but do not suffer yourself to be lulled into a state of security , by his apparent indolence ; vigilant and watchful must that woman be , who has so many foes to shield against - the unkindness <page type="Page 95"/> of Sir William - the passion and merits of Lord Lucan - the arts and malice of Colonel Walter - but the last and most formidable - shall I venture to speak out ?
- is your own heart .
</p>
<p>
You have not yet begun to suspect it .
It is therefore the more dangerous enemy .
Examine it , my sister ; call it to strict account ; and if you find one sentiment or wish , that lurks in secret there , unworthy of yourself , banish it , I beseech you : thoughts , even without purposes , are criminal , where our honour is in question .
Consider the slightest idea of this kind , as a young serpent ; though stingless now , its growth will give it strength and power to wound the breast that nursed and cherished it !
crush it , betimes , Louisa ; and be at peace for life .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 96"/> I weep faster than I write ; my brother 's unhappiness , and yours , have sunk my spirits to the lowest ebb : he is still inconsolable .
- He has received a most extraordinary letter from brute Colville - I can call her nothing else - she says , ' `` She hopes he has by this time surmounted his grief for her daughter , as it is highly irrational to mourn for one who is so surely happy .
- She intreats him to go directly to Paris , as she has something very particular to inform him of , relative to Delia 's last request , which she will not communicate by letter . '' '
</p>
<p>
This hint has roused Sir George 's curiosity , or rather awakened the fond desire of fulfilling any wish that Delia might have made ; yet he says he could not bear the fight of Mrs. Colville , whom <page type="Page 97"/> he considers as her daughter 's murderer , and the destroyer of his earthly happiness .
-
</p>
<p>
I know not what to think of this affair , but I most earnestly wish that he would go any where - exercise is always of service to an oppressed mind - like the wheels of a machine , it lessens the weight , which rest restores again - however , Sir George shall not go by Amiens , if he goes at all , and that I have any power to persuade him .
-
</p>
<p>
No one can tell where Lord Hume has been , for some time past - the only letter I received was dated from Naples , which he said he should quit the next day , and write to me the moment he was determined to fix at any place .
- If <page type="Page 98"/> a brother 's and sister 's unhappiness did not at present take up all my thoughts , and as it were usurp the place of my own sorrow , I could allow it ample scope , Louisa ; but I will now restrain it , at least within my own breast , and indulge myself in the more generous sensation of grieving for the distresses of those who are more wretched , and not less dear to me , than myself .
</p>
<p>
Sir George returns your love , an hundred fold .
I have never given him the least hint of your being unhappy , as I knew it would render him still more so .
- I do not think that even a brother should interfere , between husband and wife , unless matters were come to such extremities , as I hope they never will between Sir William and you .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 99"/> I would by all means wish you to make a friend , tho ' not a confidante , of the young Harriet ; if her heart and understanding be good , her want of knowledge in the ways of the world will not render her a less eligible companion or adviser .
There is something extremely striking in the natural sentiments of an untainted mind - they resemble the purity and delicacy of water drank at the fountain , before it has been impregnated with these adventitious flavours , which it acquires in its currency .
</p>
<p>
I know not why , but I am vastly prejudiced in Harriet 's favour - I am apt to think she will lessen your domestic uneasinesses , or at least prevent your brooding over them , in solitude and <page type="Page 100"/> silence .
- If I ever visit you in Ireland , I shall endeavour to obtain a corner of her little innocent heart : this will be no robbery ; for I flatter myself that she will love you the better , the more she loves me .
</p>
<p>
Miss Granville is returned from Bath , she is at present my only companion - within these two days Sir George has admitted her into his apartment .
She has lost all her spirits and vivacity , and is perfectly qualified to perform the part of a mute in a tragedy ; for she sighs often , and never speaks : she has not however communicated the cause of her mourning to me ; yet I fancy if she were obliged to sing a French song , Maudit amour , would be the first that would occur to her .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 101"/> You will easily perceive that my letters , like yours , are written at different intervals ; and I hope you will also perceive that my spirits are better than when I began this epistle , tho ' nothing particular has happened to enliven them , except my taking an airing with Sir George , and my quondam admirer , Mr. Loyd , in Richmond Park , this morning .
</p>
<p>
The moral of the tale I sing , as before , is , that air and exercise are the best medicines in the world , both for mind and body .
- By the way I hope you both continue and indulge your passion for riding - I hear the outlets about Dublin are delightful ; you will be unpardonable if you do n't visit them all .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 102"/> Pray give my love to the little Harriet : you may also offer it to Sir William ; for , indeed , I am , very well inclined even to bestow , since he will not suffer me to pay it to him .
</p>
<p>
Adieu , adieu , ma tres chere soeur ,
</p>
<p>
F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
P.S. Pray enquire of Lord Lucan , if he ever hears from lord Hume ?
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 103"/> Naples .
</p>
<p>
YES , my dear Lucan , I will acknowledge your censure just , in some degree ; and that I think is full as much as can be expected from a person of my lively and volatile disposition - we idle fellows are seldom perverse enough to defend our follies ; or perhaps the same indolence of temper which makes us commit , prevents our justifying them - no matter from what principle our humility arises , I hate searching for remote causes - 't is like seeking for a grain of wheat in a bushel of chaff .
I never was a good logician , tho ' a very tolerable sophist , for myself at least ; and <page type="Page 104"/> while I find the effects of my passion for the lovely Margarita , pleasant , I shall never perplex myself with endeavouring to find out why they are so .
</p>
<p>
You can not , my dear Lucan , have an idea of any thing half so charming , or you would not only excuse , but countenance my fondness , by your own admiration .
- No , hang it , I should not like that , either - nor would I have you see her , for a thousand guineas , notwithstanding what you say of your being already in love - you know I thought myself the most enamoured swain alive , when I left England , and used to write you the most doleful accounts of my sufferings - you laughed [ ... ] t them , then , I laugh at them , now - tempora , aut mores , mutantur - no matter which .
I ca n't help , <page type="Page 105"/> however , sometimes feeling a little qualm , not of conscience tho ' , Lucan , for my former mistress - she is handsome , I confess , but Margarita is divine .
</p>
<p>
When I landed on the continent , I was such a novice in love , as to fancy that I could not bear a six month 's absence from Fanny Cleveland ; but I had not been six days acquainted with my present object , when I found that I could sacrifice friends , country , nay myself , to her ; I had never felt passion before .
And ' `` What 's life without passion ?
sweet passion of love . '' '
</p>
<p>
I have , I hope , dealt like a man of honour , with Miss Cleveland , by not dissembling with her .
I have written but once to her , since I came here ; and <page type="Page 106"/> then told her I intended to stay abroad , for three years , and had not fixed upon any place of residence ; nay even said I should quit Naples directly , merely to prevent her writing to me .
</p>
<p>
I hope she will understand all this , properly , and that her pride will get the better of whatever regard she might have had for me ; and that whenever I return to England , if that should ever happen , I may find her , what I really wish , married intirely to her own satisfaction - for , notwithstanding my infidelity , I think it impossible that I should ever be capable of divesting myself of the warmest interest in her happiness .
I have now , my dear Lucan , laid my heart as open before you , as I would , were I a catholic , to my confessor .
I expect much more from <page type="Page 107"/> you , than I should from him , not only absolution and indulgence , but a reciprocal confidence also .
- Tell me who , and what , this fair Hibernian is , whose torrid charms have been able to thaw your frozen zone ?
Is it une affaire de coeur , ou d'honneur ?
is she kind , or cruel ?
brown , or fair ?
in short , deal as frankly with me as I have done with you , and we shall then have mutually exchanged the truest test of friendship , with each other .
</p>
<p>
Yours , most truly , HUME .
</p>
<p>
P.S. I purpose spending the winter here , and setting out early , in spring , either to Rome , or Venice , which ever my fair compass points her taper index to , that we may enjoy the carnival together .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 108"/> MY dear Hume , your letter has relieved me from a thousand apprehensions , which I suffered on your account - it is written in the true spirit of a heart at ease , which no man ever possessed that was thoroughly in love - and though you call me grave and philosophic , I am much better pleased that your present attachment should be of the frolic , than the serious kind .
- Most of our young men of fortune and fashion look upon a foreign mistress as a part of their travelling equipage ; and I think Margarita as well qualified to fill up the train of milord Anglois , as any other of her sister syrens - of the opera .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 109"/> I have seen her often , and acknowledge her beauty , though I could gaze on her for ever , without feeling any other effect from her charms , but what might arise in my mind from contemplating her picture - yet I do not think her inanimate ; on the contrary , she has great vivacity , both in her looks and manners , but alas !
she is totally devoid of sensibility , that first of female charms !
her eyes are taught to languish , and every graceful movement of her form has been acquired in the school of art .
- Read the thirty-seventh and fiftieth letters of Ninon de l'Enclos , to the marquis de Sevig [ ... ] é , and they will help you to judge more justly , both of her and yourself ; they are cases exactly in point .
</p>
<p>
She lived with the marquis de Richelieu , at Turin , when I was there - I <page type="Page 110"/> knew him intimately ; he adored Margarita , and was one of the handsomest and most amiable young men I ever met with - he died of a fever .
I pitied Margarita from my soul , and about ten days after his death , went to pay her a visit of condolance , and was informed she had set out for Naples , two days before , with an English gentleman whose name was Williams .
</p>
<p>
I am much too young to set up for a stoic , or a cynic ; I know , nay I feel , all the weaknesses and follies of youth ; yet I can not help thinking that an attachment to a worthless woman , is capable of debasing the noblest mind .
- Virtue , I fear , is not radical in human nature ; its seed must be sown by precept , cherished by example , and cultivated <page type="Page 111"/> by habit ; but when the object of our affections has a distinct interest rather to extinguish , than inspire it , the general bias of our passions , aided by the natural indolence of dissipation and debauchery , suffer the plant to wither in its bloom , and thus obliterates the truest character of manhood .
</p>
<p>
On the contrary , let the most vicious man become truly enamoured of a virtuous woman , and he will at least assume the semblance of those virtues he admires in her , and ' `` Use ( as Hamlet says ) can almost change the stamp of nature , and master even the Devil , or throw him out with wonderous potency . '' '
</p>
<p>
I find myself growing grave prematurely ; for there is but one paragraph <page type="Page 112"/> in your letter , that I meant to answer seriously : you may easily guess - I mean the one where you speak of Miss Cleveland , and seem to acquiesce so intirely in your behaviour towards her - and now that I have entered upon this subject , I am at a loss to know how to treat it properly - I would fain persuade myself you were but in jest ; yet surely it is wrong to trifle with the esteem of a friend , by suffering me to suppose that you could possibly behave so unworthily to a woman of merit and honour .
</p>
<p>
That the gaiety and levity of your temper and your youth might render it possible , nay probable , that you should change your affections , and cease to love a mistress you once admired , I can readily believe - but that you can suffer an <page type="Page 113"/> amiable woman , whom you both flattered , and inspired , with a serious passion for you ; to be informed of your inconstancy , through so coarse a medium as rudeness and neglect , I will not , nay I can not suppose .
- My friend knows better what he owes to himself , and to the world .
</p>
<p>
I must be excused from replying to your queries , relative to the object of my passion , except so far as to afford you some faint description of her beauty and merits .
Her personal charms are so obvious , that whoever views her does not wait to judge - they strike so suddenly that we feel before we think .
The excellencies of her character require some refinement to become sensible of - one must have a nice discernment for natural beauties , and a <page type="Page 114"/> certain classic taste for the great simple .
- Her mind is in such a state of perfect nature , that she is not to be examined by the rules of common life ; for her words , her actions , and her whole manners , borrow a peculiar propriety , from herself alone .
- She appears to be a sort of privileged genius , of whom may be said , with Milton ,
</p>
<p>
'' That whatso'er she says , or does , '' Seems wisest , virtuousest , discreetest , best . ''
In others we may trace the mechanical finger of the nurse , the mother , the tutoress , or the priest - In her can be discovered but one only forming hand - even his who made her .
</p>
<p>
In fine , such beauties , both of mind and person , have inspired your , till now , insensible friend , with the most tender , <page type="Page 115"/> ardent , and hopeless love , that ever yet possessed a human heart !
and in my breast , shall that fond love lie ever buried - I think it will not cease even with my life , but death itself shall never force me to reveal my passion .
</p>
<p>
Press me no farther on this theme , my friend , nor cast away your useless pity on me ; for while I can behold her lovely form , and gaze in silent rapture on her beauty , I am not wretched - nay in those blissful moments , I feel a sort of happiness I would not change for all your joys with Margarita .
</p>
<p>
You may , very probably , have but an imperfect idea of that kind of passion , which I have described ; but do not from thence unphilosophically conclude that <page type="Page 116"/> it can not exist in any heart , because you do not feel it in your own .
This I know to be a common , but erroneous mode of judging - we are all too apt to search in our own breasts for the motives of other people 's actions ; and when a want of sympathy of sentiment , prevents our discovering similar principles in ourselves , we are too often tempted to deny their existence in others .
</p>
<p>
I have particularly warn'd you , my dear Hume , on this subject , because I am certain I could full as easily forgive your doubting my honour , as the unsullied purity of my passion .
- I most sincerely wish you every pleasure that a life of frolic and gayety can yield , but beware , my dear Hume , of those thorns , that grow spontaneous with the rose .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 117"/> Write to Miss Cleveland , I conjure you ; and , when your leisure will permit , bestow a few lines on yours sincerely ,
</p>
<p>
LUCAN .
</p>
<p>
MAY I perish this moment if ever I read such a letter !
I shall begin to look upon Ovid 's Metamorphoses , as a history of serious , and natural events ; and not be at all surprised , if I should find myself fluttering through the air , in the form of a lapwing , or a butterfly .
- Surely your transformation is still more miraculous !
what , Lucan !
the gay , the lively Lucan !
changed into a melancholy , timid , whining , love-sick swain ; ' `` and death itself shall never force him to reveal <page type="Page 118"/> his passion ! '' '
Why what , in the name of nonsense , must she be , that has inspired it ?
deaf , and blind , I suppose - for no woman that has ears and eyes , need ever be informed that a man is in love with her - in those cases , they are sharp-sighted as the lynx , and quick-eared as the mole ; and I would lay a thousand guineas , that your Dulcinea was thoroughly informed of her conquest before you were even aware of it yourself .
-
</p>
<p>
But why you are so cruelly bent upon not indulging her with a repetition of her triumph , I can not for my soul conceive - I have formed a million of conjectures , about whom and what she is ; and have at length acquiesced in believing her to be the sanctified spouse of some methodist teacher , or presbyterian parson ; for <page type="Page 119"/> you have , according to your own plan , ' `` assumed the semblance of those virtues , '' ' which such a puritan fair one might also pretend to .
</p>
<p>
And so poor ' `` Margarita is compounded of art , and wants the first of female charms , sensibility . '' '
Beware , my friend , that your idol may not have one vice more , at least , than mine ; I mean hypocrisy - the marquis de Richelieu is still remembered and regretted , by Margarita , though she did not absolutely break her heart for his loss , as you may perhaps vainly imagine your dove-like dame , your saint trembleur , whom nothing but the spirit can move , would do for you .
</p>
<p>
In short , you are welcome to make as free with me , as you please ; the privileges <page type="Page 120"/> of friendship permit it ; but neither its laws , nor those of chivalry , can pardon an affront or injury offered to the heroine of our romance - Besides , you must be but a bad philosopher , Lucan , if you do not know that there is such a perverseness in human nature , that the abusing a mistress is the surest way of rivetting the lover 's chains -
</p>
<p>
'' I 'll be revenged , and love her better for it . ''
And so you are very angry that I have not written a full and true account of my inconstancy , to Miss Cleveland !
why how the devil can any man sit down to tell a woman that he no longer loves her ?
But 't is a proper measure ; I owe it to myself , and to the world - I repeat your words seriously , here , for I think them just .
- And now you will for ever oblige me , my <page type="Page 121"/> dear Lucan , if you will do it for me ; for may I die this moment , if I am not so wholly illiterate , in this noble science of defence , that I know not even how to set about it .
</p>
<p>
On my honour I both respect , esteem , and admire Miss Cleveland , more than any woman in the world , however the caprice of my heart may have rendered me capable of an infidelity ; and I most devoutly wish , that I had address enough to extricate myself out of this unlucky business , without sacrificing any more of my character than I fear is already forfeited .
</p>
<p>
I can not help smiling , when you say , ' `` while I can behold her lovely form , '' ' &c..
But I must acknowledge this to be <page type="Page 122"/> the best , perhaps the only receipt , in the world , for insuring our constancy - I 'll frame it into a distich , extempore , for the help of memory -
</p>
<p>
Your love would you preserve the same , Still fan , but never feed the flame .
If you were at Rome , instead of Dublin , I should swear that you were turned Virtuoso , and became enamoured of Madame la Venus de Medicis , or some other old fashioned marble beauty - the world 's a farce , and it is acted thus - the bad impose on others , the good deceive themselves .
</p>
<p>
But happiness , the way we chuse it , is sufficient for us all , and as you are so very reasonable in your option , they must be niggards , indeed , who would desire to deprive you of the least portion of it ; <page type="Page 123"/> therefore , that you may long possess ideas , is the complying wish of yours , ever .
</p>
<p>
HUME .
</p>
<p>
Southfield , January 1 .
</p>
<p>
I Have this moment received my dear Fanny 's last letter , though , from the date , I think I should have been in possession of it much sooner ; but perhaps Sir William detained it , on purpose to deliver it to me on this day , as knowing it to be the most agreeable new-year 's gift he could have presented me with .
In return then , my Fanny , accept my thanks and fervent prayer , for your happiness .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 124"/> But I have something more substantial than wishes , to contribute towards it ; for I can with truth inform you , that the little time I have spent here , has passed away much more agreeably , than any that has elapsed , since I left Dover-street .
</p>
<p>
To a mind not perfectly at ease , there is something extremely pleasing in the quietness of the country ; it is like that artificial repose , which is acquired by opiates , after long watching - like that too , though it neither strengthens , nor nourishes , it allows us time to recover our faculties , which are often as much harrassed by living constantly in the midst of crouds , as our nerves are by an acute disease .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 125"/> I am very glad to find that Sir William loves the country , and is particularly fond of this place , where nature seems to have exerted her utmost powers to please - If it is charming now , when stripped of all its ornaments , think what it will be , when summer shall redeck it in its leafy pride , and spread her gorgeous carpet o'er the plains ?
</p>
<p>
I look forward with delight to the happy aera of your arrival here , which I hope will be early in spring ; and as the Irish parliament meet but every second winter , I purpose spending the intermediate time of their recess in this sweet retirement , with my Fanny , my Harriet , my books , music , drawing , planning , planting ; and perhaps there may be a little interloper , who will , I trust , increase <page type="Page 126"/> both our pleasures and employments - my Lucy too will be near , if not with us ; for Colonel Walter 's house is about five miles from hence , and every thing seems in great forwardness for his marriage with Mrs. Layton ?
</p>
<p>
I begin to flatter myself , that he is really in love with the lady he is going to marry ; for he talks of her incessantly : yet Lucy has remarked , that he spends more of his time here than at Mr. Usher 's , where Mrs. Layton is now upon a visit ; though that is two miles nearer to Waltersburgh , ( that is the name of his seat ) than this .
</p>
<p>
He is to give a magnificent ball at his house , next week ; he asked me last night to dance with him on that occasion ; which I refused , as I thought he ought <page type="Page 127"/> to shew every mark of attention to his future bride - I shall not , however , dance with any other person ; not so much on his account , as for a reason I have hinted at above .
</p>
<p>
I fear you will chide me for not having mentioned my present situation to Sir William , as it is natural to suppose it would give him pleasure , and indeed I wish to do so ; but there is something so indelicate in his manner of treating this subject , that I have not yet been able to prevail upon myself to speak of it to him .
</p>
<p>
Lord Lucan has been absent from us some days , on a visit to Sir Arthur Ashford - they are both expected here this evening - I have great pleasure in observing <page type="Page 128"/> that Lord Lucan is vastly more chearful , and seemingly at his ease , than he was before we left Dublin - indeed I think we are all so : which serves to illustrate your favourite opinion , as well as the latter part of your last letter , that air , exercise , and change of objects , are of infinite use , both to the mind and body .
</p>
<p>
From my not mentioning my brother , till now , do not conclude that I have for a moment forgotten him , or his griefs ; they will live together in my memory , to the last period of my existence .
- I can not conceive why Mrs. Colville should wish to see Sir George , as she must be conscious of having done him an irreparable injury ; and sure there is nothing on earth so formidable , as the sight of a person we have <page type="Page 129"/> wronged .
- Yet I earnestly wish that he knew his Delia 's request , as the obeying it would afford him a very high , though a melancholy pleasure -
</p>
<p>
'' Sad luxury !
to vulgar minds unknown . ''
I wish too , with you , that he would go abroad .
- Do , my Fanny , send him to search for your wanderer , on the continent ; and in the mean time do you take sanctuary in this island , which boasts a privilege of being free from all noisome animals - you may therefore at least promise yourself safety , if not delight , amongst us .
</p>
<p>
I am sorry for the change you mention in Mary Granville ; her charming vivacity would , I hoped , have assisted you in keeping up your spirits , under the treble <page type="Page 130"/> pressure of my brother 's , mine , and your own distresses , which I begin to fear will soon outweigh our 's , for I think that even the death of the object of our affections is more supportable than their unkindness .
- This hint is meant to arm you ; for , I confess , that Lord Hume 's silence has made me think he is in the high road of inconstancy ; and I do most earnestly wish that you would endeavour to forget him , and be happy .
-
</p>
<p>
I have , my dearest sister , at your request , most seriously examined my heart , and will candidly acquaint you with its real situation - 'T is free from love , and thence is all its danger .
- O !
why am I debarred the chaste indulgence of a virtuous passion ?
why must a heart that overflows with tenderness , have all <page type="Page 131"/> its currents dammed ?
like a poor river forced from its natural course , am I to blame if it should steal away in useless , nay improper channels ?
</p>
<p>
But hitherto , my sister , all is safe - the man I most esteem , I have no passion for , nor feel a fonder warmth , on mentioning his name , than my dear brother 's - this surely is an innocent affection - Had I been his wife !
- but you have warned me not even to hazard , much less indulge , such thoughts .
</p>
<p>
Harriet is vastly happy at your predilection for her , and bids me offer you the second place in her heart - she kindly , and I believe at present truly says , I occupy the first - yours is , I think , likely to be the most permanent station ; <page type="Page 132"/> as I shall have many rivals to contend for mine , and happy will he be who shall displace me .
-
</p>
<p>
Lucy , who came hither with me , is this day gone to pay her respects to her aunt , at Mr Usher 's ; we are to meet them at Waltersburgh , next Monday ; and she is then to return with me to Southfield , where we have , alas !
but a very few days to spend , before we set out for Dublin : I shall truly regret the changing of the scene - but must obey .
</p>
<p>
Sir William returns his affectionate compliments to my brother , and you , and was kind enough to say he wished you would both come over , and see how we live here - what is still more extraordinary , he seemed both surprised and <page type="Page 133"/> concerned , when I told him of our dear Delia 's death ; for he is sometimes tender , when he is off his guard ; so that I often flatter myself that 't is rather his manners which are harsh , and not his nature hard .
You see how I strive to sooth myself , and plead for him .
He says he can not be persuaded that she could die , in three days , unless it were of a French physician .
</p>
<p>
Sir Arthur Ashford , his sister , and Lord Lucan , are this moment arrived .
I have never seen the Lady , but hear she is extremely handsome ; grant heaven that Lord Lucan may think so !
now , Fanny , you can have no doubts or fears .
</p>
<p>
Adieu , my sister -
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 134"/> REPORT does not always exaggerate - Miss Ashford is really beautiful - the ladies of this country are in general remarkably fair , but the whiteness of her skin surpasses any that I have ever seen ; her eyes are dark hazel , her hair jet black , which forms such a contrast to her neck and forehead , as images Shakespear 's simile ,
</p>
<p>
'' Fairer than snow upon a raven 's back . ''
She is tall and thin , and though not elegantly made , appears perfectly genteel - while she sits still - but the moment she is thrown into motion , or emotion , she ceases to be lovely - a something <page type="Page 135"/> more than want of grace accompanies her action , and every movement of her head , or hands , seems performed in opposition to nature - in short she is the only young person I have ever seen , whom vivacity does not become .
She seems sensible , mild , good-natured , and in every respect qualified for making an amiable figure - in still life .
</p>
<p>
I am much pleased to find that Sir William is extremely hospitable to his country neighbours , and likes to have company in his house .
This tendency may doubtless be attended with some inconveniences , which I had rather submit to , than live unknown and unloved , amongst one 's tenants and dependants - it is their industry and labour which supports our affluence , and they certainly <page type="Page 136"/> have a right to a certain share in our enjoyments , in proportion to their rank and situation .
</p>
<p>
An accident that happened this morning , had like to have triumphed over Sir William 's good humour , which is not of the invincible kind .
- As we sat at breakfast , in a room that looks into the garden , I observed Miss Ashford 's eyes fixed on a particular object , in the walk before us - I thought she seemed surprised , and I naturally directed a look of inquiry , to discover the occasion ; which was a little basket , that appeared to move , though gently , of itself .
</p>
<p>
The moment I mentioned this circumstance , the gentlemen came to the window , and Lord Lucan flew directly into the <page type="Page 137"/> garden , and explained the phenomenon , by bringing the basket and its contents into the parlour , which was an infant , about a week old , clean , though poorly clad , with a paper pinned to its breast , which said , this child has been baptized by its father 's name , William .
</p>
<p>
This circumstance disconcerted Sir William , who , after many unnecessary asseverations of his innocence , upon this occasion , at which the whole company smiled , as they knew that he had been above a year out of the kingdom , determined to prove his virtue , at the expence of his humanity , by ordering the child to be again left in the garden where it was found , till the parish officers should come to take charge of it ; and by commanding a strict search to be <page type="Page 138"/> made for the mother , that she might be punished , according to law .
</p>
<p>
We all opposed the severity of this resolution , as the poor infant appeared almost perished with cold , and hunger ; but Sir William persisted in acting like an upright magistrate , according to the letter of the law - till Lord Lucan declared that he was ready to adopt the little foundling , and promised to take care of it for life , though his name was Thomas .
Sir William then relaxed a little of his austerity , and gave vent to the remainder of it by attacking Lord Lucan with all the coarse raillery usual upon such occasions .
</p>
<p>
I confess I was pleased with this instance of his Lordship 's humanity - I <page type="Page 139"/> have seen many others , even in the short term of our acquaintance - yet , at this instant , I could wish to have robbed him of this little act of benevolence , and have transferred it to Sir William - There is a secret and involuntary sympathy , that attaches us to generous minds - our affections are insensibly rivetted by esteem , and in that case we may defy even the power of time to break the charming tye !
O , why am I not bound in such a chain !
</p>
<p>
Though you will see by my letter , that I had nothing to say when I began to write , yet as it is probable that I shall not have half an hour 's leisure , for some days to come , I have devoted the present moment to convince my Fanny that she is never absent from my thoughts , to enquire <page type="Page 140"/> after her 's and Sir George 's health , and to assure her of the sincerest regard , of her ever affectionate
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
DIstracted as I am with my own griefs , let me thank my dear sister for having removed some of those apprehensions which I had suffered on her account ; and by that means leaving my heart , as it should now be , devoted to selfish , undivided sorrow .
- Lord Hume is false , Louisa !
I am forsaken , in the pride of youth ; but for whom I know not .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 141"/> I can not write , read the inclosed , then give the hateful scroll to the devouring flames - no , send it back - alas !
for what ?
the fatal lines are graved too deeply , on my breaking heart !
</p>
<p>
My brother set out for Paris , last week ; a second letter from Mrs. Colville , more ambiguous than the former , determined him : I am glad he is gone , - I should have tried , but fear it would have been in vain , to hide my anguish from him - and he has griefs too weighty of his own , to suffer me to add resentment to them .
</p>
<p>
You say your heart is free from love , Louisa : O , triumph in that blest indifference !
and know you can not taste the extreme of wretchedness , without feeling <page type="Page 142"/> a tender passion for an unworthy object !
</p>
<p>
'' Ah !
fond remembrance blinds me . ''
If I were capable of joy , I should receive it from the hint you give , of your being soon likely to be blest with a proper object for your utmost sensibility !
Repine no more , my sister , but let the current of your fondness flow in this most natural and pleasing course ; in the rich channel of maternal love .
</p>
<p>
I intreat you to acquaint Sir William , as soon as possible , with this happy event ; there are numberless reasons that render it proper : those you urge against it , are childish ; your situation must naturally increase his tenderness , and of course your happiness , which is all that <page type="Page 143"/> can now diffuse the smallest gleam of satisfaction , to your ever affectionate
</p>
<p>
F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
P.S. I have this moment received a second letter from you , for which I return my thanks ; but am not , at present , able to write more .
</p>
<p>
MADAM ,
</p>
<p>
A Consciousness of error is , they say , the first step toward reformation ; but there are some cases , in which we may be sensible of having done amiss , yet find it impossible to amend : this is certainly a very unpleasing situation , and well worthy of pity , from a generous <page type="Page 144"/> mind .
- So circumstanced I acknowledge myself , and throw myself at your feet , for pardon .
</p>
<p>
Can you , madam , rise so far above the unworthy man who asks it , as to grant him your forgiveness , while he confesses that the natural inconstancy of his sex , and the mutability of his disposition , have triumphed over a passion , which was once his highest happiness , and honour ; and which he then thought would have been as permanent , as his life ?
</p>
<p>
I can not , without descending to the meanness of a falshood , affect to suppose that I am indifferent to you ; I know but too well that I was honoured with a place in your affection - but I also know that <page type="Page 145"/> Miss Cleveland has sense and resolution sufficient to conquer her regards for one who owns himself unworthy of it - Humiliating confession !
</p>
<p>
Let me , however , madam , as a motive to your forgiveness , plead the small , and only merit , that is in my favour , the not having attempted to deceive you .
- I can now only add , that notwithstanding the change of my affections , rather than my sentiments , I shall ever retain the sincerest respect , and , if I may be allowed the expression , the tenderest esteem , for Miss Cleveland , to whom I have the honour to be
</p>
<p>
a most devoted , and obedient servant HUME .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 146"/> Waltersburgh .
</p>
<p>
HOW happy should I be , my dear madam , in having the honour of paying my respects to you by letter , and thanking you for the kind partiality you have expressed in my favour , to my dear aunt , if her illness had not been the occasion of my writing : but do n't be alarmed , madam , she is at present out of danger , though still so weak as to be unable to write , even to you .
</p>
<p>
She was taken ill , the day after she came here , and miscarried , the day following .
How I grieve for the loss of my dear little cousin !
he would have been a charming <page type="Page 147"/> play-thing for us all .
You ca n't imagine how much my uncle has fretted about it : but though my poor dear aunt has the most reason to be sorry , she bears every thing with her usual sweetness of temper - but I need not expatiate on her gentleness , to you who know her , for every creature who does , must be charmed with her .
</p>
<p>
Miss Leister , who was to have been here with us , was confined with a quinzy , at Mr. Usher 's , when my aunt grew ill ; but she came to us , yesterday , and the gentlemen are all gone to Dublin - It was intended that we should be very merry , when we arrived here , but I never saw such a dismal house ; I long to get back to Southfield , which I hope we shall be able to do , in a few days .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 148"/> My aunt desires me to assure you of her tenderest affection , and says she will write , the moment she can hold a pen .
</p>
<p>
I hope my dear Miss Cleveland will not take an aversion to me , for being the messenger of disagreeable news , but believe that it would have afforded me the sincerest pleasure , to have informed her that my aunt was as well and happy as I know she deserves to be , and I most truly wish her .
I have the honour to be , dear madam ,
</p>
<p>
your much obliged , and most obedient servant HARRIET WESTLEY .
</p>
<p>
P.S. I do n't know whether you are acquainted with Lord Lucan ; but I ca n't <page type="Page 149"/> help telling you , that he had the misfortune to sprain his leg , so that he could not dance , or walk , even the first day he came - there never was any thing so unlucky as this party has been !
for every one has had something to distress them .
</p>
<p>
I Lament with you , my dear Harriet , that our correspondence should commence on an occasion so painful to us both , as Lady Barton 's illness ; but I should be unworthy of that regard which you seem inclined to shew me , if it were possible that I should conceive any dislike to you , for acquainting me with our common misfortune , I mean the loss of our <page type="Page 150"/> little cousin - however , as you assure me that my sister is at present out of danger , I think we may reasonably hope that our present loss may be repaired in future , and that we may yet have many pretty play-things , in which we shall be mutually interested .
</p>
<p>
The sweetness of Lady Barton 's temper must interest all who know her , in her sufferings of every kind , and lessen even to herself the painful sensations arising from her present disagreeable situation - Such is the potent power of gentleness !
I have no doubt of your tender attachment to her ; there is a natural sympathy between the good and amiable , which far exceeds the ties either of affinity or consanguinity .
</p>
<p>
I have not the honour of knowing Lord Lucan , but am sorry for the accident he <page type="Page 151"/> has met with , both for his sake and yours , as I fancy his lameness interfered with the amusement you proposed to yourself , in dancing .
- But we are all liable to disappointments , my young friend ; and may this be one of the greatest that you shall ever experience !
</p>
<p>
Assure my beloved sister of my servent and unceasing wishes for her speedy recovery .
And believe me to be my dear Miss Westley 's
</p>
<p>
affectionate friend and servant F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 152"/> Waltersburgh .
</p>
<p>
MY dearest Fanny , I lay hold of the first possible moment to calm your fears for my safety , I mean with regard to my health : Harriet , by my desire , has given you an account of the accident that befel me here ; but she and all the world are strangers to the cause of it .
</p>
<p>
But before I enter into a detail , that must affect you , let me congratulate my dearest sister upon the timely discovery of lord Hume 's inconstancy - Rejoice , my Fanny , that this worthless man is not your husband !
and that you are at <page type="Page 153"/> liberty to indulge your resentment , or contempt , without a breach of duty - This , though you may not be sensible of it , is certainly an allevation of the misery which arises from ill-placed love - but time , and your sense and virtue will , I hope , enable you to triumph over any remain of weakness , for such an unworthy object - Yet , contemptible as he is , I can not help being pleased with his letter ; frankness always charms me , and , like charity , in my mind it covers a multitude of faults .
</p>
<p>
Do not , from what I have said , imagine that I think lightly of your present distress ; I am convinced , that to a heart tender and good as yours , it must be severe ; but I also know , that there are other situations much more intolerable , <page type="Page 154"/> and I am almost tempted to exclaim with Lord Littleton .
-
</p>
<p>
'' What are , alas !
thy woes , compared to miner ? ''
You shall be yourself the judge , and I will now proceed .
Sir Arthur , Miss Ashford , Lord Lucan , Sir William , Harriet , and I , set out together for this place , the Monday after I wrote to you - We were to have met Mrs. Layton , Miss Leister , the family of the Ushers , and several other ladies and gentlemen of the neighbourhood - The first mortification I received , was hearing that my Lucy was ill of a sore throat , and could not come from Usher 's Grove ; her aunt , and the rest of the family came , but were all to return after supper .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 155"/> I told you , in my last , that I had refused to dance with Colonel Walter ; I was also asked by Lord Lucan , but desired to be excused , and entreated he would take Miss Ashford for his partner .
He said he would obey me , and accordingly desired the honour of her hand , which she readily granted - About a quarter of an hour before the ball began , he unluckily strained his leg , and was not able to fulfil his engagement .
- Sir William , though not fond of dancing , was polite enough to supply his place , and Lord Lucan and I were reduced to play at quadrille , with a couple of dowagers , and an old parson .
</p>
<p>
The evening , however , passed off , very tolerably , and we retired to our chambers about twelve o'clock .
The gentlemen <page type="Page 156"/> had agreed to meet and hunt , the next morning ; and I determined to pay a visit to Lucy , between breakfast and dinner , that day ; for the Colonel had insisted on our not leaving him till the next .
</p>
<p>
According to appointment with his companions of the chace , Sir William rose early , and left me asleep ; I had resolved not to acquaint him with my situation , till our return to Southfield ; as I knew that many coarse jests and common-place sayings would pass , on the occasion ; which I should wish to avoid , at all times , but especially before strangers .
</p>
<p>
About eight o'clock in the morning , I was waked by a person who knelt at my bedside , and pressed my hand to their lips - the chamber was dark , I could <page type="Page 157"/> only distinguish that it was a man , and instantly concluded him to be Lord Lucan ; from this circumstance only , that I recollected Colonel Walter was to have rode out with Sir William .
- I strove to withdraw my hand , but could not ; upon which I addressed him with the strongest expressions of surprize and resentment , at his having dared to take so unwarrantable a liberty ; to which , he answered , only in a whisper , entreating me to forgive the effects of a passion too violent to be restrained .
- He then attempted to press his lips to mine , and when I was going to ring my bell , I heard Sir William 's voice upon the stairs , and fainted .
</p>
<p>
When I came to myself , I found Miss Ashford , Sir William , and Harriet , in <page type="Page 158"/> the room , standing about my bed-side - I suffered infinite anxiety at that instant , to know whether Sir William had found Lord Lucan in my chamber , and what had passed between them ?
Harriet and Miss Ashford were bathing my temples with lavender water , while Sir William held one of my hands between his , and as soon as he found that I was recovering , press'd it gently , and withdrew ; saying that he supposed ladies understood how to manage one another better , in such circumstances , than he - his calmness amazed me !
in short the various emotions of my mind , for some time , are not to be expressed .
</p>
<p>
I determined , on the instant , to return to Southfield directly , let the consequence be what it would ; and never to suffer <page type="Page 159"/> Lord Lucan to come into my sight again ; but , alas !
when I attempted to rise , I found it impossible ; the agitation of my mind , had disorder'd my whole frame ; my illness encreased every moment , a messenger was dispatched for a physician , but before he could arrive -
</p>
<p>
When Sir William was informed of my misfortune , he raved and stamped like a mad-man ; said I must have designed to destroy his heir , out of perverseness , or I would certainly have acquainted him with my situation - while , Heaven knows , I would have given my own life , with pleasure , to have saved my child .
</p>
<p>
I continued in a state of such extreme weakness , for four days , that I saw no creature but Benson , who had been sent <page type="Page 160"/> for express , the doctor , and Harriet who wept continually by me - I never can forget the dear girl 's tenderness .
</p>
<p>
On the fifth morning , Sir William came into the room , and with an air of the utmost disatisfaction , told me he was very sorry for the loss of his boy , but hoped I should do well ; and as he could not be of any use to a sick person , he had resolved to attend the meeting of parliament , and should set out for Dublin , with the Colonel and Lord Lucan , directly - that as soon as I was able , I might either return to Southfield , or follow him to town , as I liked best .
- But that I need not be in a hurry to move , for his good friend had left orders that I should be as well attended , as if I were in my own house ; and that Lucy Leister was now recovered , <page type="Page 161"/> and would come that day to Waltersburg , to keep me company .
- He then gave me a cool kiss , and withdrew .
</p>
<p>
I rejoiced extremely , at hearing that Lord Lucan was to go with Sir William ; for though my life was at stake , I would not have remained in the same house with him , after my husband had left it ; besides it saved me the difficulty of an interview , which my poor weak brain had been studying to avoid , the whole time of my illness - Yet I had doubts and fears that he might insolently have made a pretence to stay behind , till Benson assured me that she saw him set out , at the same time with Sir William and the Colonel .
</p>
<p>
Just as he was going off , he gave the enclosed note to Harriet , to deliver to <page type="Page 162"/> me as soon as I should be able to read it ; the sweet girl could not conceal her emotion about it , she feared she had done wrong in receiving it , and , with her cheeks covered with blushes , and her eyes filled with tears , she presented it to me , begging I would excuse her if she had acted improperly .
</p>
<p>
I never was more embarrassed , in my life , than at that moment ; I could have no doubt but that his letter was filled with apologies for the audaciousness of his conduct , and to read it was in some measure to admit of his excuses .
- But while I hesitated , Harriet , whose impatience seemed to be extreme , had broken the seal , and said , shall I read it to you , Madam ?
Luckily for me that part of the chamber I sat in , was so much darkened <page type="Page 163"/> by a large screen , that she did not discover my confusion ; therefore taking my silence for consent , she proceeded to read , as follows .
</p>
<p>
To Lady BARTON .
</p>
<p>
PERMIT me , Madam , to express those ardent wishes for your recovery , which I have never ceased to breathe to heaven , from the first moment of your illness - wishes as pure , as warm , and as disinterested , as brothers form for a beloved sister !
I hoped to have had the honour of seeing you before I leave Waltersburgh , and I have many reasons to lament the loss of that happiness ; but the cause which has prevented it , is even more a subject of regret , than the effect ; and , like Aaron 's rod , has swallowed up all other considerations .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 164"/> May returning health a wait your couch , and may every happiness that heaven can grant to merit such as yours , be as truly thine , as the sincere respect and esteem of him , who has the honour to be , Madam , your Ladyship 's
</p>
<p>
most obedient servant , LUCAN .
</p>
<p>
P.S. .
If it be not thought too presuming , I should request the favour of your permission for Miss Westley to honour me with a line , to inform me of your health .
</p>
<p>
I never felt surprise more strongly , than at hearing this letter ; and my amazement was rather increased , by the trepidation and hurry of Harriet 's voice and manner , in reading it , who , on the instant <page type="Page 165"/> she had finished , desired I would give her leave to write his lordship an account of my health , by that very night 's post .
- This I absolutely forbad ; but , in order to change the subject , told her I would employ her in a more interesting correspondence , and desired she would immediately write to you .
</p>
<p>
I confess to you , Fanny , that Lord Lucan 's letter has puzzled me so much , that I sometimes think it impossible he could have been guilty of the insult I have charged him with , and not attempted to have made some apology for it .
- Yet who else could have dared to enter my chamber ; or , indeed , who else was in the house , at the time ?
I am almost tempted to persuade myself , sometimes , that it was only a dream or vision , that <page type="Page 166"/> alarmed me - at other times my mind suggests some scruples to itself , for not having acquainted Sir William with the affair .
- But then again , in that case , I must have hazarded my husband 's and some other person 's life !
dreadful though !
No , let me rather suffer all that fate can inflict on innocence , than be the cause of one man 's death , or misery !
</p>
<p>
The moment that Lord Lucan left the house , I felt as if a weight had been taken off my heart - I have grown better every hour since , and the company of my Lucy and Harriet makes me not regret the absence of any other person , but yourself - For heaven 's sake , my dearest Fanny , no longer deny me and yourself the indulgence of sharing my heart , and alleviating its anxieties !
you have now <page type="Page 167"/> nothing to detain you in England ; my brother will most probably stay abroad , some years .
- But I will not say more ; for if your own inclination and my situation do not impel you , I would not wish that my persuasions or intreaties should compel you .
</p>
<p>
I have been three days about this letter , and think it high time to conclude ; but must first acquaint you that the day Benson came here , she discovered a private door in my chamber , which leads to another apartment , through which I conclude that Lord Lucan had made both his entry and retreat ; or else Sir William must have met him going out of my room , at the time I fainted .
- Adieu , my Fanny ; I will write to you , as soon as I get to <page type="Page 168"/> Southfield , which will be , at farthest , in three days .
</p>
<p>
Yours ever , L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
WHY must I tell my dear Louisa , that the contents of her letter abated the pleasure I received from seeing that her hand had superscribed it ?
this little circumstance gave me an idea of your perfect recovery , while the same characters on the inside , trace out a tale of unhappiness and distress !
and who can hope for health , while the mind suffers ?
</p>
<p>
There is something very extraordinary , in the adventure you have met with , <page type="Page 169"/> at Waltersburgh ; but your surmise on that occasion does not appear to me to have the least foundation - on the contrary , I would almost hazard any bett , that Lord Lucan was incapable of treating you with such disrespect .
It is impossible , I think , from the whole contour of his character , to suppose that he could be guilty of such an outrage to decency and honour ; still more incredible to believe , that he should never since have thought proper to offer any sort of excuse for such a behaviour , especially as he proceeded so far as to frame an opportunity to himself for doing so , by the respectful freedom of his letter to you ; for an action too , which was so unfortunate in its consequences , to the woman he loves - for that he loves , is but too obvious .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 170"/> Who then could it be ?
That indeed , I must be at a loss to answer , any more than yourself .
- I am half persuaded , and I wish I was intirely so , that it was only a dream - But be that as it may , I think you were perfectly right , in concealing the affair from Sir William , as the knowledge of it must have been fatal , at least to his repose , and yours .
</p>
<p>
I am very sorry , that Sir William should have shewn more regret for the loss of his son , than concern for your illness ; but parental fondness is , I fear , a stronger and more general affection , in male minds , than conjugal love .
- But , indeed , my dear , you deserve a little mortification for your false delicacy , in concealing your situation from him ; so kiss the rod , and have done <page type="Page 171"/> whimpering , as we say to naughty children .
</p>
<p>
I most earnestly wish that the business of parliament had not called Sir William from home , at this juncture ; I long till he and you are settled in a domestic way , at Southfield - I own I am alarmed at a married woman 's meeting with adventures of the novel kind - in the absence of her husband -
</p>
<p>
'' The wife , where danger or dishonour lurks , '' Safest and seemliest by her husband stays , '' Who guards her , or with her the worst endures . ''
To say truth , I think you in almost as much danger as our fair mother , to whom these words were addressed , for there certainly is a serpent in the grass , somewhere , autour de vous - You have , however , the advantage of being warned of <page type="Page 172"/> your danger , provided you construe the billet you sent me as its first whisper ; and , as a woman 's best safety is found in retreat , I wish you would resolve to withdraw yourself from any further intimacy , either with Lord Lucan , or Colonel Walter - believe me , my Louisa , they are both dangerous intimates , though in a different way .
</p>
<p>
I receive your congratulation as I am sure it is meant ; and though my mind is not yet strong enough to consider the discovery of Lord Hume 's inconstancy , as a subject for rejoicing at , yet I agree with you , that had this change in his affections happened after I had become his wife , the misfortune would have certainly been more insupportable ; though I can not , even at present , avail myself of <page type="Page 173"/> the resource you offer me , of hating or despising a man whom I once loved - The utmost I ever hope to arrive at , is to be able to speak of my affection for him , in the past tense only ; and the most effectual way to arrive at that end , is to mention him as little as possible , for the future .
I hope your next letter will inform me of your returning health , and happiness ; I need the assistance of them both , to support my present wretchedness - May they long attend my beloved sister , sincerely prays her affectionate
</p>

F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 174"/> DEAR Hume , I should be extremely pleased , if I could , like you , consider the transformation of Ovid , as a series of serious and natural events ; for as I have , for some time past , become extremely weary of my present form or mode of existence , I should be inclined to flatter myself , that any change must be for the better ; but the metempsychosis of Pythagoras would suit me still better than the metamorphoses of Ovid ; I should like to carry my identity with me , into whatever being my spirit was appointed to animate , as I think the consciousness of the sufferings I now endure , would render any state , except <page type="Page 175"/> that of a ferocious animal , agreeable to me .
</p>
<p>
But to be serious - I have been , for some months past , uncommonly wretched ; the fate of her who is the arbiter of mine , hung for an age in doubtful ballance .
I never knew the extreme of misery , till then ; for , alas !
I had never before given myself leave to think she was mortal !
Yes , Hume , all that I love in life was near the grave !
and I sustained the shock like a philosopher - I sighed and wept in secret ; while to the world I wore the specious mask of mere humanity .
- This was as much as I had power to do ; and he that says philosophy can go beyond this mark , and teach us not to feel , mistakes its use , and makes dull apathy usurp its place .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 176"/> I do n't know that ever I felt so much pleasure in writing as at this moment ; it certainly relieves our oppression to unburthen our hearts , and you are my only confidant - This declaration may appear strange to you , who know so little of the particulars of my attachment ; but when I affirm , that no person breathing knows so much , not even the dear object of it , you may , nay you must , accept the title .
</p>
<p>
From your last letter , which I have read over several times , I have collected two things which give me sincere pleasure , but will surprise you extremely ; the first is , that you endeavour to persuade yourself that you love Margarita much better than you really do : and the second , that you not only respect <page type="Page 177"/> and esteem , but still love Miss Cleveland !
I hope you have written to her , Hume - Every woman of worth and honour has , and ought to have , a proper pride ; neglect is therefore the most unpardonable of all offences that a man can commit - I speak of men , not brutes ; rudeness is , of course , out of the question .
</p>
<p>
I was extremely diverted at the many ridiculous ideas you formed of the object of my passion ; but this , be assured of , and let it satisfy you , that neither her mind or body have been perverted by any kind of art , but that she is at this instant the most perfect work of the great and universal Artist , that I have ever yet beheld !
though perhaps she may not have struck you , ( for you have <page type="Page 178"/> seen her , ) with the same idea of perfection .
</p>
<p>
I perfectly agree with you that the word happiness has as many various meanings , as there are tempers and constitutions in the world ; to confine it therefore to any taste , passion , or mode of life , would be just as absurd as to drain your ponds , that your fish may fly ; and flood your aviaries , that your birds may swim .
Be it , therefore , unto you , as you have wished it unto me , that is , as you choose it .
- Adieu , my dear Hume .
</p>
<p>
Yours most truly , LUCAN .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 179"/> Venice .
</p>
<p>
I Have often told you , my dear Lucan , that I never trouble myself to investigate causes for any thing that happens ; effects are enough for me : so that whether your transmogrification be according to the Ovidian , or Pythagorean system , is of no sort of consequence ; for transmogrified you are , to all intents and purposes - You may divert yourself with looking for the etymology of that word , but though I do n't believe you will be able to find its derivation in any dictionary , it is a devilish good one , for all that , and truly expressive of my meaning .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 180"/> Why , my dear metamorphosed friend , you had nothing of the Catullus strain in you , while you lived among us here .
But there are peculiar disorders incident to certain climates , and an heavy atmosphere naturally makes people draw their breath in sighs .
Fly then for your life , my dear patient , and take the air of the world , once more among us again , before your ailment has confirmed itself into a Platonic asthma in the bogs of Ireland .
</p>
<p>
You have puzzled me to the last line of a riddle , by saying that I have often seen your Lesbia - pr ` ythee , be good natured , Lucan , and tell me when , and where ; for guessing is rather troublesome : there can be no sort of danger in letting me know who she is , as you are <page type="Page 181"/> already convinced that I do n't like her ; or if I did , may I perish if I would attempt to rival my friend with any woman breathing ; you may , therefore , be perfectly safe , in making me a real confidant , instead of a nominal one .
</p>
<p>
Margarita and I have been here this fortnight , and in that time we have contrived to lose a good round sum at play : she thinks we have been overmatched , by the Venetians , and wants to try our fortune at Rome ; but I must wait for remittances from England , before I can make this or any other experiment of the kind .
</p>
<p>
You are mistaken , Lucan .
I love Margarita most truly ; and , what is much more extraordinary , my affection for her <page type="Page 182"/> rather increases than abates - I have myself been made sensible of this , tho ' not in the most agreeable manner ; for I have lately felt somewhat of that hydra of calamities , jealousy - and this , though I am perfectly satisfied that my sweet girl gave me no sort of cause , on her part , and would not quit me , for an emperor -
</p>
<p>
'' Tell me , my heart , if this be love ? ''
You are in some measure right , with regard to my sentiments for Fanny Cleveland .
- I certainly do most thoroughly esteem her , and have given the strongest proof of my having an high opinion of her understanding , by writing a very foolish letter , acknowledging myself , what , I dare say , your wise worship already thinks me , a very silly fellow .
- I do n't know , but as you say , I may love her too - that is , according <page type="Page 183"/> to your plan of loving , à la seraphique - but I have no idea of that sort of passion which can admit of a doubt , or allow us time to reason about the why or wherefore of the matter - Let me be charmed !
my senses captivated !
and let reason go to the schools , if it will ; for I never found it of any use , but to torment me .
- I am all impatience for my remittances ; I do n't like this place , nor does Margarita , though she has a number of relations here , brothers and cousins , by the dozen ; but they are all priests , and I am apprehensive that some of these infatuates may persuade her to quit me , and lock her up in a convent - the dear girl sometimes alarms me much , by talking religiously ; but if I can get her to Rome once , there will be an end of these fears ; for I am told , that there is not even the shadow of devotion there .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 184"/> It is now two o'clock at noon , and Margarita has not yet blessed my eyes ; I fear she is not well - I must go to enquire her health .
I hope your fair one is recovered : do , tell me all about her , in your next .
Direct to me at Rome ; I forget where , but to the care of your former Banker .
</p>
<p>
Adio , mio caro amico .

HUME .

</p>
<p>
THANK Heaven , my dearest Fanny , I have at last escaped out of that worse than lyon 's den , that detestable Colonel Walter 's house !
- On the <page type="Page 185"/> day after I wrote last to you , as the weather was remarkably fine , for the season , I insisted on Lucy and Harriet 's going out to take the air ; and , in order to harden myself for my removal , I ventured into the room adjoining mine , which is a very large and handsome library .
- Benson had told me , that , since the Colonel went to Dublin , she had sometimes seen a beautiful little girl , of four years old , running about the house , but that the child could not speak English ; and that the servants were extremely ill-na-natured to the poor baby , who used to weep when she could not make herself understood ; that she was perfectly engaging in her manner , and seemed to take a liking to Benson ; that she had enquired , as much as was proper , who the child belonged to , and was constantly <page type="Page 186"/> answered , that they knew nothing more of her , than that she was one of their master 's importations .
</p>
<p>
Upon this report I confess that I felt my relationship to dame Eve very strongly ; and desired Benson to bring the child to me , the first opportunity - She accordingly led her by the hand into the library , on the day I have mentioned ; but the moment the child saw me , she would have fled , and exclaimed in French , O my papa will kill me !
I replied to her , in her own language , and assured her that no harm should happen to her - She smiled upon me , and asked was I a French-woman ?
if I was , she would love me dearly ; for all the people in this place , she said , were cross , and cruel , except her poor mama , that she believed was <page type="Page 187"/> dying - She then hid her face , with her little hands , and burst into a passion of tears .
</p>
<p>
I need not tell you how I was affected - She became instantly sensible of my tenderness , and suffered Benson to lead her to me , and set her on my knee ; but though she leaned her head upon my neck , and seemed pleased with my caresses , I could perceive that fear predominated over every other sensation , by her eyes being constantly directed to the door , and her appearing alarmed , at every noise .
- I asked her where her mama was ?
She paused for a few moments , and then replied , I was not forbidden to tell that ; she is above stairs , lying upon her bed , and that bed is on the ground - We do n't lye so in France .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 188"/> The innocence and sensibility of her remark quite overcame me - She took my handkerchief , and dried my eyes ; then said , ' `` Do n't weep !
pray do n't !
you do n't sleep upon the ground , nor any one else , I believe , except my poor mama . '' '
Again I kissed the lovely little pratler - I desired her to tell her mama , that I should be glad to see her - She shook her head ; and said that was impossible ; for her mama was too sick to come out of her room ; but if she were well , she must not disobey her papa , and he had commanded her never to stir out , while she lived .
- Then said I , my dear , I will go up to her - She answered quick , ' `` No !
no !
that can not be , the servants would tell my papa . '' '
- I asked her would she carry a letter to her mama ?
she said yes - I then asked her mama 's name , and she <page type="Page 189"/> answered D'Olivet - I instantly sat down and wrote in French , what follows -
</p>
<p>
A Madame D'OLIVET .
</p>
<p>
Madam ,
</p>
<p>
I have this day seen and conversed with your lovely daughter ; and , from her innocent , yet sensible discourse , I have learned that you are ill , and unhappy .
- I have reason to apprehend that the treatment you have received , from a gentleman of this country , may naturally prejudice you against all its inhabitants ; but let me assure you , that humanity and justice are the real characteristics of this nation ; and that if you stand in need of either , you may depend on meeting them in the highest degree , both from our manners , and our laws .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 190"/> I beg leave now , Madam , to offer you any assistance that is in the power of an individual of your own sex , of some rank and consideration in this country ; who will esteem it a very great happiness if she can be in any way serviceable to the injured , or oppressed ; and who most solemnly assures you , that whatever confidence you are pleased to repose in her , shall never be made use of , but to your own advantage , as it is not curiosity , but compassion , that inclines her to interest herself in your concerns .
- If you think an interview with the writer of this proper , please to contrive the means , and she will most readily concur with your design , as she is possessed of the sincerest inclination , though unknown to you , to do every thing that may be in <page type="Page 191"/> her power , for your service ; and is with great truth , your unknown friend ,
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
The child carried away the billet , and returned in less than ten minutes , to tell me that her mama had neither pen , ink , or paper ; but if I would be so good to let her have them , she would write an answer immediately , and in the mean time returned me a thousand thanks , for the honour of my letter .
- The dear little Olivet took my hand , kissed it , and said she was sure she should love me ; for she thought I had done her mama good already .
- I immediately furnished her with my own porte-feuille , which contained all the necessary implements for writing ; and waited , not without some degree of impatience , to have this mystery <page type="Page 192"/> explained .
- Lucy and Harriet returned from their airing , soon after this adventure ; but I did not think it proper to mention the affair to them , till I was more fully informed myself .
- I heard nothing farther of the child , or her mother , till I retired into my bed-chamber , and then Benson gave me a letter in French , which I send you inclosed .
</p>
<p>
To Lady BARTON .
</p>
<p>
Madam ,
</p>
<p>
No words can adequately express my sense of your goodness to me ; but my gratitude shall , while I have life , be poured forth in fervent prayers for your happiness - This , alas !
is the sole return that I can make to Heaven , or to you , whose blessed instrument I am sure you are , to speak peace and comfort to a dying <page type="Page 193"/> wretch , and smooth her passage from this vale of misery !
</p>
<p>
Ah , Madam !
may you never know the transports I received from reading your dear letter !
they can only be felt by one equally unhappy with me , if such another wretch there be on earth , who , long denied the blessings of society , debarred even the power of speaking to be understood , should have an angel come and utter , words of comfort and compassion .
</p>
<p>
Forgive me , Madam , but I can not help considering you as a superior being , sent to the relief of misery like mine !
O , may you think so too , and ease my last sad moments of their sharped pangs !
It is not for myself I plead , but for my innocent , my unoffending child !
Receive a <page type="Page 194"/> more than orphan to your care , and my last sigh shall waft my thanks to heaven !
</p>
<p>
Even the short story of my misfortunes , is much too long for my weak hand to write ; but if you will permit me , Madam , to throw myself at your feet , when all the family are retired to rest , and condescend to lend an ear to my sad tale , I will relate it with the same truth and frankness , as I would to my confessor ; you shall supply that solace long denied me , and from your gracious lips I hope for absolution .
</p>
<p>
I have now no terms to keep with Colonel Walter ; the hour approaches that must dissolve all the engagements that ever were between us : how he has fulfilled his part of them , Heaven and his <page type="Page 195"/> own heart can tell !
but even in my death , I would not wish to offend him ; and were there not a much dearer concern than my own life at stake , I would conceal his unkindness to the last moment of my existence , would suffer my wrongs to be buried with me , and sleep for ever in the silent grave .
- But my Olivia !
my lovely little babe !
pulls at my heart-strings !
and can I then decline the offer of your kindness , and not strive to interest your compassion , for her future fate ?
impossible !
circumstanced as I am , the mother must prevail over every other tye .
- I therefore again entreat the honour of being admitted to your presence , this night ; I will come softly down the back-stairs that join to the library , and there wait till your woman shall conduct me to you - In the mean <page type="Page 196"/> time , and ever , allow me to subscribe myself , with the most heart-felt gratitude ,
</p>
<p>
your ladyship 's most obliged , and devoted servant , OLIVIA WALTER .
</p>
<p>
Judge of my feelings , at reading this letter , by your own !
But though I know you will be displeased at my quitting the story here , I must break off , as the post is going out , and I can not send this without telling you that I have no remains of my late indisposition , but weakness - Peace of mind , and exercise will , I hope , soon restore my former strength - To-morrow , my Fanny , I will indulge you with the remainder of this affecting narrative , till then
</p>
<p>
Adieu ,
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 197"/> THE moment I had read Mrs. Walter 's letter , I sent Benson to wait her coming at the appointed place .
- As some of the family were not yet gone to bed , I had near half an hour 's leisure to reflect on the uncommon villainy of Colonel Walter !
If this lady was his wife , which I could have no doubt of , from her taking his name , how did he dare to propose marriage to Mrs. Layton ?
But this circumstance appeared trifling , when compared to the inhumanity of his behaviour to the unfortunate Olivia , and her lovely child !
At length Benson tapped softly at my door , and I rose to receive <page type="Page 198"/> a being that seemed no longer an inhabitant of this world .
- From the child 's account of her mother 's illness , I was prepared to see a person pale , and emaciated ; but any thing so near our idea of a beautiful spectre , never yet , I believe , struck mortal sight .
</p>
<p>
I must describe her to you - her stature is some-what above the middle size , but the extreme thinness of her figure , made her appear still taller - her eyes are large , and of the darkest blue ; her nose aquiline , with the most beautiful mouth and teeth I ever saw ; her skin fairer than alabaster , and so clear , that one might fancy they saw the circulation of the blood , which supplied a faint blushing in her cheeks , resembling the inner tints of a white rose ; her hair of a light shining brown , <page type="Page 199"/> flowed in loose tresses upon her shoulders - her gown was a white silk polonese ; she had on a gauze hood , tied loosely under her chin , and a slight covering of the same sort , upon her neck ; she appeared all form without substance , spirit without matter ; and had she prophesied , my faith would have listened , as to an angel .
-
</p>
<p>
As she entered my room , she made an effort , which I was not lucky enough to prevent , to throw herself at my feet - when I attempted to raise her from the ground , I had not strength sufficient , for she had fainted there ; with Benson 's assistance and mine , she recovered , in about ten minutes , then gushed into such a flood of tears , as took away all power of <page type="Page 200"/> speech , and almost suffocated her ; she often tried to speak , and implore my pardon for the distress and trouble she had occasioned me ; and you may suppose that I said every thing in my power to calm her mind .
</p>
<p>
As soon as she became a little collected , she said it was joy , not sorrow , that had overpowered her weak frame ; the latter she had been too familiar with , but the former was indeed such a long absent guest , that it must be welcomed with some degree of transport .
- If the delicacy of her sentiments had needed any addition , they would have received the highest from the sweetness of her voice , and the uncommon beauty of her mouth , while she uttered them .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 201"/> In order to restrain her acknowlegements for my interesting myself about her and her child , I pressed her to relate her story , and to account for the extraordinary appearances arising from her situation .
She bowed , and proceeded with so much grace and elegance of expression , that I could have hung with mute attention on her speech , for a whole winter 's night , or a long summer 's day , and never wished her tale to have an end !
</p>
<p>
The Story of Mrs. WALTER .
</p>
<p>
I had the misfortune to lose my father , who had the honour of being a general officer in the king of Sardinia 's service , when I was but eleven years old ; his name was d'Alemberg - as he had many great and lucrative employments ; and my mother and he were both young , <page type="Page 202"/> they indulged themselves in a thoughtless extravagance together , at Turin , during his life - But at his decease , my mother , no longer able to support the rank she had held at that court , retired to BrianÁon , to live upon the small patrimony which remained for her and me .
</p>
<p>
Young as I was , the loss of a fond father made a very deep impression on my mind ; and the perpetual affliction to which I saw my mother had devoted herself , and which terminated her life in two years , brought me full early acquainted with sorrow .
</p>
<p>
After this irreparable loss , I remained at BrianÁon , under the care of an old maiden aunt of my father 's , who had lived too much sequestered from the <page type="Page 203"/> world , and who , ignorant of the nature of youth , or how to guide it , supplied the place of instruction , with austerity , never suffered me to be a moment out of her sight , and was for ever extolling her own goodness and charity , in being troubled with the care of my education and maintenance .
- In short , her manners were perfectly disagreeable , and so extremely different from that delicacy and tenderness , to which I had been too much accustomed , that , tho ' I strove to respect her , as my aunt , I found it impossible either to love or esteem her .
- The affections of young and amiable minds can not center in themselves ; and if they are not properly attached by the ties of affinity , or kindness , they will most probably bestow themselves on improper objects .
- This was unluckily my case .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 204"/> The only person I was suffered to converse with , except my aunt , and that only at home , was a girl about three years elder than myself , whose mother had been formerly a servant to mine , but at that time kept an inn at BrianÁon .
- This girl then , as was natural , I became extremely fond of ; and as my aunt grew every day more infirm , and was often confined to her bed , I found frequent opportunities of visiting my dear Nannette , unknown to my severe guardian , at her mother 's house .
</p>
<p>
In one of these , till then , innocent excursions , my ill fate contrived that Colonel Walter should arrive at BrianÁon , and stop at the house where I was - It was summer , the evening fine , and , as he had no company , he sauntered into <page type="Page 205"/> the garden , where Nannette and I were sitting at work , in an arbour - He accosted us with great politeness , and I could perceive that my companion was highly pleased with his address - But the timidity natural to a person who had been brought up in so retired a manner as I had been , made me wish to withdraw ; and , notwithstanding his , and Nannette 's solicitations to the contrary , I quickly returned home , possessed with the first idea I had ever felt , of having done wrong .
</p>
<p>
I saw , by the Colonel 's appearance , that he was an officer ; the recollection of my father struck forcibly into my mind , and I blushed with indignation to think that general d'Alemberg 's daughter had been seen in so improper a situation .
<page type="Page 206"/> My pride was , however , consoled by thinking that I should never see him again ; and I determined to be more guarded , in my future visits to my friend .
</p>
<p>
The next morning , very early , Nannette was at my bedside , and expressed some degree of resentment at my having quitted her so abruptly , the preceeding night - my delicacy would not suffer me to hurt her pride , by telling her my real motive for retiring ; I therefore said that it was owing to my apprehensions of being missed by my aunt ; but that I got off undiscovered , and should not be so cowardly , another time : she seemed satisfied with this declaration , and pressed me to come to her , that evening .
She had an intire ascendant over me , and notwithstanding the resolution <page type="Page 207"/> I had made a few hours before , I readily promised to attend her .
</p>
<p>
I had no doubt but that the Colonel would by that time have quitted BrianÁon ; and I would not venture to ask a question relative to him , lest it might lead her to suspect my thoughts : she however talked of him incessantly ; said he was the handsomest , and most agreeable gentleman she had ever seen ; told me he had invited her mother and her to supper , and behaved to them as if they were princesses ; and added she was glad he did not live in that country , as she feared another interview might engage too much of her affections .
She rattled away in this manner , till I was summoned to attend my aunt , and then made me repeat my promise of going to <page type="Page 208"/> her the moment the old lady should retire to rest .
</p>
<p>
My aunt was , if possible , more peevish than usual that whole day , or at least her ill temper had a more than common effect upon my spirits - I longed for the evening to be released from her tyranny , and to be indulged with the liberty of pouring forth my little sorrows in the bosom of my faithful Nannette .
</p>
<p>
The moment that my aunt had dismissed me from her chamber , I flew to my appointment , without waiting to alter my dress , which was a perfect deshabille , and found Nannette in the arbour , adorned with every little ornament that she was possessed of .
My <page type="Page 209"/> thoughts were too much affected with the disagreeableness of my own situation , to make reflections on the gaiety of her appearance .
</p>
<p>
I seated myself by her , leaned my head upon her bosom , and , with a profusion of tears , told her I was no longer able to bear the misery I suffered from my aunt 's severity .
- She smiled , and , as I thought , with an air of triumph , told me that I might put an end to my misfortunes , as soon as I pleased , for that the Colonel had assured her he had visited all the courts in Europe , and had never seen any thing half so beautiful , as either she , or I. - That for her part she was resolved to try her fortune in the world , forthwith , and not stay moping at BrianÁon till she grew old and ugly ; <page type="Page 210"/> and that if I would accompany her , she did not at all doubt of our success ; that I might hope to marry some reigning prince , and that she might at least expect to be mistress of a dukedom .
</p>
<p>
I was both shocked , and surprised , at hearing my friend talk in this extravagant and unusual stile ; but before I could express my sentiments , Colonel Walter came into the arbour , dressed as if he had been going to court on a gala day - I confess I was struck , nay dazzled , with his appearance - from the time of my leaving Turin , I had never seen any man finely or elegantly dressed , before : I now quickly perceived the advantages that Nannette received from being decked out , and blushed at the inferiority of my own appearance .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 211"/> Every human creature has , I believe , some sparks of vanity in their nature , and this was the fatal moment when mine were first kindled : a desire of outshining Nannette , who had a good deal disgusted me , took immediate possession of my thoughts , and my countenance was , upon the instant , lighted up with smiles .
- I have not a doubt but Colonel Walter saw through the thin veil that covered the sentiments of a creature so young and artless as I was then ; he at least indulged my weakness , even beyond my wishes , by intirely devoting his whole attention to me , and totally neglecting my companion .
</p>
<p>
Olivia here broke off her narrative , to apologize for entering into such minute circumstances , which she said was meant <page type="Page 212"/> to convince me of her sincerity , as she was very certain that her weakness and innocence were the ground works of her ruin - ' `` But , alas !
( exclaimed she , ) is there not indulgence and compassion due to uneducated uninformed fifteen ! '' '
</p>
<p>
I told her that her entering into those little traits of character , those fine , those delicate touches , marked the master 's hand , and were a convincing proof of the goodness , both of her head and heart .
She complimented me on my candor , and returned to her story .
</p>
<p>
There had been the most elegant repast provided , that BrianÁon could afford ; Nannette , and her mother , the Colonel and I , were all the party ; but I was the idol to whom all the incense was offered .
The good woman of the <page type="Page 213"/> house took the ton from her guest , extolled my beauty and my accomplishments , as extravagantly , though not so agreeably , as he .
- Nannette alone was silent - In short , I became intoxicated with flattery ; and when the time of our parting drew near , I secretly lamented at the same idea which had given me so much satisfaction , the preceding night - that I should see Colonel Walter no more !
</p>
<p>
The Colonel insisted on attending me home , and had ordered his chaise to convey me to my aunt 's - But though my vanity was flattered with this mark of attention , I dared not indulge it with such an eclat ; however , I said I would permit him to walk home with me , provided Nannette would accompany us - She sullenly refused - I had <page type="Page 214"/> then no choice , and the Colonel and I set out together .
</p>
<p>
When we were about to separate , I wished him a good night , and a pleasant journey - He threw himself at my feet , caught hold of my hand , swore I was the sovereign arbitress of his fate , and that he would never leave BrianÁon , till he had obtained my hand , and heart ; but that if I cruelly refused to accept his love , he would put himself to death , that instant , before me .
</p>
<p>
Child as I was , his transports terrified me ; I was also alarmed lest any of my aunt 's servants should see him , so I promised , if he would then retire , to meet him , the next evening , at the inn .
- He made a merit of assenting to so <page type="Page 215"/> long an absence , and after a thousand protestations of the most ardent passion , and as many more tender adieus , he left me plunged in such a fatal , yet pleasing delirium , as youth and experience only , can feel .
What an infidel should I have thought the person who had at that moment warned me to discredit the sincerity of his profession !
The night passed away , without sleep , yet I thought it short , and arose , next morning , even with unusual vivacity - My aunt 's ill temper was no longer disagreeable to me , my spirits were perfectly harmonized , all was peace within , and chearfulness without - Towards evening I began to think that time lagged heavily in its course , and wished for the setting of the sun , as much as a benighted traveller for its rising .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 216"/> At length the welcome night arrived , and set me free from my restraint ; I ran to my toilet to endeavour to adorn the few graces that nature had lent me .
- In vain - confusion interrupted my efforts , and haste prevented my dispatch , so that , in a kind of despair , I threw aside my few ornaments , snatched up a little straw hat , and set out on my adventures , in the same careless deshabille I had appeared the night before .
</p>
<p>
The moment I had got out of the view of my aunt 's house , I was met by the Colonel , who received me with an extasy , that I believe was then sincere ; we pursued our way to the arbour , where he had first seen me - On my not finding Nannette there , I endeavoured to quit him and go in pursuit of her , but he <page type="Page 217"/> held my hand , and entreated me to stay till he had revealed a secret to me , which was of the utmost consequence to us both .
- He then assured me that Nannette was not my friend , and requested that I would not intrust her with the discovery he had made of his passion to me , for that he feared she would betray the secret to my aunt , and by that means deprive him of more than life , the happiness of seeing me ; but that if I would be a little upon my guard , she might suppose his attachment to be nothing more than common galantry , which might , possibly , quiet the jealousy she seemed already to have conceived about it .
</p>
<p>
I was shocked at the idea of deceiving or suspecting my friend , yet the <page type="Page 218"/> gloom and dissatisfaction that appeared in her behaviour , the night before , made me too readily fall into this snare ; nay , I joined in the deceit against myself , by entreating that he would be more attentive to her , and less particular to me , on the present interview .
My motive for this request , I solemnly declare , was rather to prevent her being mortified , as I saw she had been before , than to remove any suspicion she might have entertained of me - For as I had perfectly acquiesced in the Colonel 's honour and integrity , as well as my own innocence , I had not the least apprehension of any ill consequence , in such a compliance .
- Thus did this artful man disjoin me from the only person who was likely to see through his designs , and could have an interest in preventing my ruin .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 219"/> After this discourse , and abundance of protestations of the tenderest affection , we joined Nannette , and the Colonel left us for some time together , to try , as I presume , the strength of his power over me .
- Nannette was all gayety , and shewed me abundance of presents that she had received from the Colonel .
My heart reproached me for concealing its sentiments from her , but my promise to my lover had tied my tongue , and the weakness and vanity of her conduct left me less reason to regret the mortification she must feel , when she should know that he was seriously attached to me .
</p>
<p>
This evening passed away less pleasantly than the former - Nannette assumed a superiority over me , in sense and judgment ; but attempted to soften her <page type="Page 220"/> self-sufficience , by hinting at the difference of our years , and experience ; and though this salvo did not render her behaviour less disgusting , it deprived me of the power of resenting it , and I retired home convinced that there were two passions awakened in my mind , that I had never felt before , love , and hatred .
</p>
<p>
Nannette and the colonel accompanied me home - At parting , he put a little billet into my hand , which I could not refuse to accept , without letting her know that it had been offered .
I was even then become the slave , the abject slave , of love , and feared to offend my future tyrant !
The billet contained nothing more than a repetition of passionate and tender expressions , with the warmest acknowledgments for the attention <page type="Page 221"/> I had shewn to his request , by the prudence and propriety of my conduct , and the most earnest entreaties to favour him with my company , the next evening .
</p>
<p>
I retired to bed , and I hoped to rest , but sleep was vanished , and with it the charming delirium that had kept me waking the foregoing night - Short was the road that I had travelled in the flowery path of pleasure , yet I already found it strewed with thorns !
I trembled at the danger of treading it alone , and lamented more piously then , than ever , the loss of my dear mother , to whom I might have confided both my hopes and fears , upon this hazardous adventure .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 222"/> The usual hour of my rising arrived , and found my eyes unclosed , and my thoughts unsettled ; I had neither slept , nor determined on any scheme , for my future conduct ; and when my maid came into my chamber , I stept out of bed , burst into a passion of tears , and said softly to myself , I will not see the Colonel - at least , this day .
</p>
<p>
I considered this determination as an amazing effort of resolution , and fancied I had gained a complete victory over my infant passion .
The anxiety of my mind , with loss of rest , had brought on a slight degree of fever ; and the moment I quitted my aunt 's chamber , I retired to my own , threw myself on the bed , and desired my maid to leave me .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 223"/> The poor girl , who loved me tenderly , was alarmed at my situation , and ran directly to Nannette , to tell her I was ill , and to beg she would come to me - She told her she was at that time so particularly engaged , that it was impossible for her to stir abroad , but that she would certainly see me , some time in the evening .
</p>
<p>
I knew nothing of this transaction ; and after having passed some hours in a disagreeable state of restlessness , the agitation of my mind subsided , and I fell asleep .
- Some time after I was awaked by a light at my bed-side , and on opening my eyes I perceived Nannette , and Colonel Walter , disguised in womens cloaths , standing by me ; the confusion which I felt , both from my situation , <page type="Page 224"/> and his , is not to be expressed - He gazed upon me , with such a look of ardent tenderness , as covered me with blushes .
I turned my eyes away , begged they would withdraw into another room , and promised them that as soon as I had rendered my appearance decent , I would wait on them .
</p>
<p>
Nannette burst into a loud laugh , at what she called my affected delicacy ; said she supposed every body was sometimes undressed , and she did not see any occasion for making a difficulty about such trifles .
- The boldness of her manner while she spoke , increased my distress , and completed the dislike I had began to have conceived for her - The Colonel appeared infinitely more modest , in his deportment , and on his making a sign <page type="Page 225"/> to her to leave the chamber , they both withdrew .
</p>
<p>
The hurry of spirits which this unexpected visit had occasioned , was increased by my apprehensions that some of the servants might detect the Colonel under his disguise ; and though I knew they all loved and pitied me , yet I had been taught in my infancy , to dread the putting myself in the power of a servant , and never to let them know a circumstance which I wished should be kept secret .
</p>
<p>
The moment that I entered the room where my guests were , I entreated them to leave me , and mentioned my reasons for wishing them gone .
- Nannette again made a jest of my scruples , but the Colonel <page type="Page 226"/> treated them more seriously , and asked my pardon for having brought me into any difficulty or distress , by his indiscretion , but pleaded both his , and Nannette 's anxiety for my health ; and insisted on my returning with them to the inn , since he was certain , from my appearance , that I had not any complaint to prevent me .
-
</p>
<p>
But not to detain you , Madam , longer , with such tedious circumstances , I , half reluctantly , complied with his entreaties , and for about three weeks longer , we spent every evening together , almost in the same manner as the first .
</p>
<p>
I had by this time lost all affection and esteem for Nannette , and had now no confidante or friend , on earth , to whom <page type="Page 227"/> I could disclose the secrets of my heart , but the single person in the world from whom I should most carefully have concealed them .
</p>
<p>
When he had become quite certain of his empire over my affections , he proposed my quitting BrianÁon , with him - he said my aunt was too old and perverse to be consulted , on such an occasion ; that he neither wanted nor desired any treasure but myself , for that all other considerations were below his attention - he added , that his passion for me had detained him so long , at BrianÁon , that he was in danger of forfeiting his commission , and his honour ; that if I loved him , I ought not to hesitate about putting myself under his protection ; that our interests were now become one , and that he would <page type="Page 228"/> defend me from every misfortune , to the last moment of his life .
- I believed , obeyed , and repented !
</p>
<p>
Here she paused - for this little reflection was followed by such a passion of tears , that I was obliged to restrain my curiosity , as you must your 's , for some time - I administered drops and water to my fair biographer ; and to you I recommend patience , till the next post ; for my fingers are so tired , that it is as impossible for me to proceed , as it is to think , or write , upon any other subject , till I have finished this : therefore not one word shall I say of myself , but that I am well , that I long to hear from you , and that I am most affectionately your 's ,
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 229"/> TAKE notice , my dear Fanny , that I am not used to narrative writing ; you must , therefore , make allowances for me , and excuse my being sometimes too circumstantial , and at others , too diffuse .
- I can only say that my translation is , what all others pretend to be , a faithful one .
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it is so much the worse , for that reason , for while I am endeavouring to convey the minutest circumstances to you , the elegance of expression which gave them consequence , in the original , is lost .
- But no matter for the manner of recital - if the story interests and affects you as much in the reading , as it does <page type="Page 230"/> me in the writing , I shall be satisfied with my own performance .
</p>
<p>
As soon as the fair Olivia had regained her composure , she proceeded thus - Weak , young , and infatuated with passion , as I was , the Colonel 's proposal of flying with him , without marriage , alarmed me , and awakened all the sentiments of delicacy , which are inherent to an innocent and virtuous mind ; yet that very delicacy prevented my having resolution to express my thoughts upon that occasion - I feared to injure his honour , by seeming to doubt it .
- I therefore remained , for some time , silent upon this most interesting subject - He repeated his entreaties , and pressed me to determine .
</p>
<p>
I replied , that I would consult my confessor .
He had seen the various workings <page type="Page 231"/> of my mind , and was prepared to evade all my scruples - He objected instantly to my proposal , by urging that a priest would oppose my marrying an heretic , and endeavour to prevent it , by acquainting my aunt ; but told me he had a particular friend , a clergyman , at Embrun , who would make no difficulty of uniting us together .
- Thus did this artful man lull all my doubts to rest , and soothe my unwary mind into a perfect dependance upon his honour , fidelity , and love .
</p>
<p>
The night following was fixed for our departure , and in an evil and inauspicious hour , I ventured on a world unknown , with the most inhuman and ungenerous of his sex , for my conductor - I had perhaps as little to regret at leaving BrianÁon , as any young creature who ever <page type="Page 232"/> took so rash and unadvised a step - I wounded not the heart of a fond parent !
nor drew a pitying tear from any friendly eye !
I had no sister , on whom my disgrace might be reflected !
nor a brother , whose tenderness might lament , or honour have resented my misconduct !
- I stood , as it were , alone in the universe ; was dear to no one , but the loved object under whose protection I now had placed myself , and in whom all the affections of my heart were centered !
</p>
<p>
Yet notwithstanding this very peculiar situation , my heart trembled , and my eyes overflowed , when I got into the chaise , and every league that we traveled , the dejection of my spirits increased - For some time the Colonel endeavoured to dissipate my melancholy , by the utmost <page type="Page 233"/> tenderness , and I affected to appear more chearful , in compliment to his attention - but he soon roused my languor into resentment , by taking some unwarrantable liberties , which , when he found I would not suffer , he attempted to excuse , by saying that he had already considered me as his wife .
</p>
<p>
The moment we arrived at Embrun , he left me in the inn , to go , as he said , in pursuit of his friend , the clergyman - He returned , in about an hour , with a person to perform the ceremony ; and we were married directly , but without any other witness ; for I had thrown myself out of a situation to prescribe terms , and must therefore have compounded for having my own scruples satisfied , by a consciousness of my being his wife , leaving <page type="Page 234"/> the opinion of the world to its own charity about me .
</p>
<p>
We remained two days at Embrun , and then set out for Marseilles ; during our long journey , my husband told me that he had some reasons for wishing to change his name ; and that in compliment to my christian one he would be called Olivet .
- I readily acquiesced in whatever he thought proper , without attempting to enquire into the motives of his conduct .
We took a house at Marseilles , and lived for four months , in the utmost retirement , and the most perfect happiness together - I never stirred out , but to church , or to take the air with my husband ; every wish of my fond heart was accomplished , and I secretly rejoiced that he no longer talked <page type="Page 235"/> of joining his regiment , or returning to his native country .
</p>
<p>
About that time his temper and manners began to alter ; he was frequently sullen , and gloomy ; and if I attempted to enquire into the cause of this change , he would answer , Thou art !
and command me to leave him - I obeyed , and used to retire to my chamber , and pass whole days and nights , in tears .
- But whenever he condescended to speak to me with chearfulness , I instantly forgot his past unkindness , and vainly flattered myself that it would return no more .
</p>
<p>
At length , with some appearance of tenderness in his manner , he told me that he was under an absolute necessity of leaving me , for a few months , as my <page type="Page 236"/> situation would not admit of my travelling with him , from my being far advanced in my pregnancy of Olivia ; but that he would certainly come back to me , by the time I should be recovered from my lying-in , and take me with him to Ireland , where his estate lay .
</p>
<p>
All that I had ever suffered in my life , seemed slight , to the misery of parting with him ; I knelt , I wept , and implored him not to abandon me , under such circumstances !
He was unmoved by my tears , and entreaties ; and in a few days afterwards quitted Marseilles , without even bidding me adieu .
- The grief I felt from this separation , would I hoped have terminated my life ; and I fear I should have been tempted to have shortened the date of my wretched existence , <page type="Page 237"/> had not the tenderness which I felt even for my unborn babe , restrained my hand from the too frequent effects of despair .
My situation was certainly deplorable , and I then thought that my misery could not admit of addition - I have been since but too strongly convinced that there are numberless gradations in wretchedness , and that I was then but entering on my novitiate .
</p>
<p>
I was so totally absorbed in sorrow at being forsaken by an husband , whom , notwithstanding his unkindness , I both respected and loved , that the common concerns of life never occurred to me , till my maid came to ask me for money , to support my family , which consisted of two maids , and a man servant .
I started , as from a dream , and in an agony <page type="Page 238"/> of grief ran to the Colonel 's desk , where I found twenty louis d'ors , sealed up in a small box , labelled thus ,
</p>
<p>
To OLIVIA D'ALEMBERG .
</p>
<p>
THIS sum , if used with care , will bring you through your lying-in ; but you must immediately discharge two of your servants .
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Here again the fair mourner 's tears interrupted her recital , and must also put a stop to my translation , for the present .
I wish extremely that I had finished the task I have undertaken ; for the sympathy between us is so strong , that I feel my health wasting as her tale proceeds .
There is a story , that some unhappy woman had blasted a great oak-tree , <page type="Page 239"/> once , by constantly mourning her griefs beneath its shade .
This fable does not appear unnatural to me , under my present sensations .
- And yet so sweet the poison is , that I would rather have listened to her doleful ditty , than to all the carols of the most festive mirth .
</p>
<p>
What can be the reason of so unnatural a preference ?
How oddly compounded is the human heart !
But most admirably framed , surely !
for what appears to the vulgar , to be its contradictions , are , in the language of philosophy , but its contrasts only .
Its perfection consists in this , as much as the harmony of nature depends on an opposition of elements - The heat of fire , the coldness of water , the heaviness of earth , and the lightness of air .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 240"/> You may observe that I take the advantage of every opportunity , for reflection , in order to guard my mind as much as possible , from the danger of thinking .
I shall leave you to explain this paradox to yourself , and am , my dearest friend ,
</p>
<p>
your truly affectionate , but unhappy sister , L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 241"/> MY dear Fanny , I am now sitting down to conclude , I hope , the sufferings of my fair Narrator , which I shall endeavour to do without any further interruption ; for though the listening to her story , had a great deal of what I deem the luxury of woe in it , I fear that this delicate sensation may have evaporated , from the frequent breaks in the recital , as much as the original spirit has , in my translation - but at at all hazards , I will now proceed .
</p>
<p>
On perusing this shocking and surprising manuscript , continued Mrs. Walter , <page type="Page 242"/> my head turned round , and I had just presence of mind sufficient to convey it into my pocket , before I dropt upon the floor .
The servants heard me fall , and came to my assistance .
- Happy would it have been for me , if they had spared their cruel officiousness , and suffered me to have expired at that moment !
</p>
<p>
My distress and despondency , upon this occasion , may appear unaccountable , perhaps , to others .
An husband 's leaving his wife , sometimes , upon several occasions of business , was not so uncommon a case as to have alarmed me .
- But there is a sort of praesentiment , in the mind , which often forebodes approaching ills ; philosophy must here be at a stand .
This circumstance can not be accounted <page type="Page 243"/> for from nature , as the present situation may have no sensible connection with the future events ; nor can such an effect be imputed to Providence neither , without the impiety of supposing it capable of rendering us wretched , before our time , by giving us a hint of misfortunes to come , without supplying us with the means of avoiding them .
</p>
<p>
Besides , did not the address of his billet , the stiling me by my own sirname of d'Alemberg , instead of Walter , or even that of d'Olivet , which he had artfully prevailed on me to assume , during our residence together at Marseilles , sufficiently evince that he no longer meant to consider me as his wife , for the future ?
This circumstance too , supplied me with a strong reason , also , to suspect <page type="Page 244"/> that in reality I had no legal title to that claim , as the unknown person who had so clandestinely performed the ceremony , might not probably have been properly qualified , by the orders of any church , to have officiated in the marriage rites .
</p>
<p>
It was , perhaps , no small aggravation to my misfortunes , to reflect , that had not my own indiscretion aided his dishonour , I should not now have been so totally abandoned , unjustified , unfriended , and unsustained , to the sport of fortune , to the mercy of a malignant , censorious , and unpitying world !
</p>
<p>
Some days after this event , I was lying on my bed , in a state of stupid distraction , when the sudden stopping of a <page type="Page 245"/> chaise at my door , roused me from my lethargy - I leaped off the bed , and flew down stairs , crying out , he is returned , my life , my love , my husband !
- But judge of my astonishment , madam , when I saw Nannette enter the door - Her face was thin , and pale , but she appeared farther advanced in her pregnancy , than I , and seemed , from the expression of her countenance , to be , at that instant , in the pangs of labour .
</p>
<p>
She accosted me with the grossest abuse , called me vile , deceitful wretch !
said I had seduced her husband from her , that she was come to claim him , and to cover me with the infamy I deserved ; alternately called for her dear Colonel Walter , and implored assistance to save her 's , and her infant 's life .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 246"/> Amidst the variety of passions , which in those moments preyed upon my wretched heart , compassion was the strongest !
I had her immediately conveyed to my chamber , and placed in my own bed ; I sent for the bed assistance that could be had , and in a few hours she was delivered of a son , who lived but three days .
The agitations of her mind brought on a violent fever , but even in her ravings she continued to accuse me as the sole cause of all her sufferings , and uttered the most vehement imprecations against me .
</p>
<p>
From the moment of Nannette 's arrival , I could perceive that my servants treated me with less respect than usual ; they doubtless believed her story , and thought that my receiving her into my <page type="Page 247"/> house , was at once a proof both of my guilt and fear .
- The physician and apothecary who attended her , divulged the tale abroad , and I was looked upon by the whole city of Marseilles , as one of the most abandoned wretches .
</p>
<p>
I know nothing that creates such an irksome sensation in the mind , as imputed guilt ; but the very delicacy that makes us feel it most , serves to restrain us from entering into a vindication ; as this would be to admit it possible , at least , it might be true .
- Under such a difficulty I then laboured , and this nicety , supported by the natural courage of innocence , inclined me rather to acquiesce in the censure , than engage in so public a justification of myself , as this unhappy woman 's charge against me seemed to require ; <page type="Page 248"/> and she was not herself , at that time , in a fit condition , either of mind or body , to have listened to my defence .
</p>
<p>
Nannette 's - delirium continued about fifteen days , during which time the miserable pittance that Colonel Walter had left me , was exhausted , and I was seized with the pains of labour , without being mistress of a single livre , or credit in the place .
Death was , at that time , the supreme object of my wishes ; yet in regard to my dear babe , that now approached the light , I sent for my confessor , related to him every circumstance that I have repeated to you , implored his protection for the unborn innocent , and put a shagreen case which contained the portraits of both my parents , with some jewels , into his hands , which had been <page type="Page 249"/> bequeathed me by my dear mother , on her death bed , and which I had ever since preserved as a relic , with the most pure devotion .
</p>
<p>
Truth generally affords conviction to an ingenuous mind ; the good father heard my story , believed it , pitied my distress , and gave me every consolation that my wretched state could admit of , by administering the rites of the church , and assuring me , in the most solemn manner , that he would take the utmost care of my child , in case it should survive its unhappy mother .
I likewise recommended Nannette to his humanity - He promised that while she remained ill , all her wants should be supplied ; and if she recovered , he would furnish her with the means of returning home again to her mother .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 250"/> Peace once more took possession of my breast , and a thorough resignation to the will of Heaven triumphed for a while over that distracting inquietude , which had well nigh destroyed both my mind and body - But the arrow of incurable affliction was still lodged in my heart , and the temporary calm that I then enjoyed , was occasioned rather by my weakness than my strength .
</p>
<p>
It pleased Heaven that I was soon and safely delivered of my beloved Olivia ; and from the moment of her birth , all selfish apprehensions vanished ; I no longer felt a pang , but for her ; and never ceased lamenting her being involved in the miseries of her mother !
Though doating on her as I did , I a thousand times wished she had been born of any other parent !
<page type="Page 251"/> and yet am certain I would not have parted with her to a queen .
</p>
<p>
In about ten days after I was brought to bed , the good father , who had supplied me with every necessary , and visited me constantly , came into my chamber , with an unusual vivacity in his looks - Be of good cheer , Madam , said he ; Providence never forsakes the virtuous and patient sufferer - Heaven has been pleased , through my weak endeavours , to raise you up a friend , who is at once inclined and capable of relieving you from your distress , and establishing a certain supply for your future competence .
- Madame de Fribourg will be here in a few minutes , and is coming to take you under her roof and protection ; but , before it is possible for you to remove <page type="Page 252"/> there , I will inform you how this instance of good fortune has been brought about , and furnish you with some instructions , that may conduce towards rendering you agreeable to your patroness .
- But while he was yet speaking , the marchioness de Fribourg entered , and interrupted him .
</p>
<p>
I have already told you , that I had lodged Nannette , in my own chamber , and was of course obliged to lye-in , in my maid 's room - The first words the Marchioness uttered , were , Heavens !
what a place for the child of my friend !
my dear madame d'Alemberg !
She stept forward and embraced me , then raised her glass to her eye , and surveyed me with the most critical and distressing attention ; I was so extremely confused , both by the suddenness and manner of her <page type="Page 253"/> entering and address , that I could neither speak nor move .
</p>
<p>
From the death of that dear mother she mentioned , I had never seen a woman that was capable of inspiring me with respect , or awe , before - her appearance commanded both - A sudden gush of tears relieved me for a moment , and seemed to soften the farouche demeanour of my future benefactress .
- She quickly made an apology for having mentioned my mother , seated herself by me , laid aside her glass , and took my hand with infinite grace , but no softness .
</p>
<p>
The marchioness was about fifty years old , she was uncommonly tall , had been remarkably handsome , her eyes large , black , and piercing ; but the whole contour <page type="Page 254"/> of her countenance was rather hard than pleasing - there was an air of fierté expressed throughout her whole appearance , that inclined you , at first sight , rather to fear than love her .
</p>
<p>
She told me , that my confessor , who was also her 's , had informed her of my distress , but that chance had brought her acquainted with my being the daughter of her friend ; that , as such , I might depend on her good offices , and regard : and added , that she hoped I should be ready to set out with her , in a few days , for Paris , where she was then going ; and that she would order her woman to provide a proper nurse to leave my child with .
</p>
<p>
The idea of parting with my daughter , shocked me extremely - I fell at her feet , <page type="Page 255"/> and as if she had been the arbitress of my fate , implored her not to divide me from my child !
said that this infant was now the only blessing I possessed in life , and that nothing but death , or her happiness , should ever part us .
</p>
<p>
She gazed at me with a mixture of surprise and contempt , and said , that if Pere Guillaume had informed her I was such a pretty simpleton , she would have saved me and herself the trouble of a visit ; but that she believed there was something contagious in folly , since she found herself inclined to comply with my absurd request , though she detested children ; but that her hotel at Paris being large enough to prevent her hearing it squall , I might bring the brat with me , provided I did not insist on her being plagued with it , during our journey .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 256"/> I was transported with even this uncouth and forced permission ; I kissed her hand , and bathed it with my tears ; told her she had rendered me extremely happy , and that I would endeavour to deserve her indulgence , by every mark of gratitude and attention in my power .
She seemed pleased , and somewhat affected ; and at quitting me , she gave me a purse of fifty Louis-d'ors , bid me prepare for my journey , by that day sennight ; said she would not desire me to come to her house , at Marseilles , because she meant to surprise her husband , by finding me in her suite , without his knowlege , and desired that I might still retain the name of d'Olivet .
</p>
<p>
This was the most sudden transition I had ever experienced , from sorrow to <page type="Page 257"/> joy ; and tho ' I could not possibly know what sort of state I was going to enter into , yet I thought any change must be for the better - It was also the first time I had ever had any thing like business to transact in my life ; and the having it in my power to discharge my debts and servants , composed my mind into a state of the most pleasing tranquility imaginable .
- Nannette , however , remained still a weight upon my spirits , in addition to that misfortune that then did , and ever will oppress them .
</p>
<p>
In a short time after the marchioness had left me , the good father Guillaume returned ; he brought with him the shagreen case , which I had intrusted him with , the contents untouched , except a diamond ring which he had been obliged to <page type="Page 258"/> dispose of , to answer the expences of my family ; and delivered me twelve Louis d'ors , the remainder of thirty he had sold it for .
- The sight of my dear parent 's pictures affected me extremely ; I kissed and bathed them with my tears , and most piously thanked my good patroness in my heart , for this article of her bounty , more than all the rest , that she had saved me from the misery of parting with those dear remains .
</p>
<p>
Father Guillaume told me that he had related my story to madame de Fribourg , without mentioning who I was , and shewed her the jewels , in hopes that she would purchase them , which she refused ; but the moment she beheld the portraits , she snatched up one of them , exclaiming with surprize and joy , this , this is - was - <page type="Page 259"/> my near relation , and my dearest friend , Olivia d'Alemberg !
upon which he acquainted her with my name and family ; and she promised on the instant to take care of me , but insisted on his not informing me that she had acknowledged any manner of affinity between us .
</p>
<p>
He then gave me the marchioness 's character and history , in a few words .
- Pride , vanity , an insatiable desire of admiration , and a fondness for play , he said , were her great foibles ; but that she was friendly , generous , and humane , when these virtues did not interfere with her passions - He said she had been married young to the marquis de Fribourg , that he had been dead about ten years , and had left her immensely rich ; that she had since married monsieur de Lovaine , <page type="Page 260"/> a young soldier of fortune , who treated her very cavalierly , and of whom she was extravagantly fond and jealous - He told me that he had furnished me with this little charte du païs , in hopes I should be able to steer my course by it , to safety and happiness .
</p>
<p>
He then informed me that he had written to a friend of his , in Ireland , to inquire after Colonel Walter ; but that , as I had not been able to ascertain even the name of the province where his fortune lay , it was possible , nay probable , from the dissoluteness of his character , that I might never see or hear of him again .
- He intreated me , therefore , to strive wholly to forget him , and devote my whole attention to the cultivation of the marchioness 's friendship , and the <page type="Page 261"/> education of my child - He promised to remember me in his prayers , and to favour me with his advice by letter ; then took a most affectionate leave of me , as he was obliged to quit Marseilles , for a few days , to perform some business , by command of his superior .
</p>
<p>
I had not seen Nannette from the time of my being taken ill ; but as I knew she was recovering , though slowly , I fancied I was then able to bear an interview with her , and acquaint her with my design of quitting Marseilles : I meant to offer her every assistance in my power , and take leave of her , I hoped , for life .
</p>
<p>
I accordingly proceeded to her chamber - but no words can express the surprise and horror that affected me , at seeing <page type="Page 262"/> her - Her whole frame was convulsed , and every feature distorted and enlarged .
The moment she beheld me , she seemed to acquire new strength , and endeavoured to revile me with as much bitterness , as when she arrived first at Marseilles .
</p>
<p>
She had , however , no longer the power of raising any passion in me , but pity - I said every thing that was possible to calm her mind ; assured her I had never knowingly injured her ; and that I had certainly been as much , if not more , imposed on and deceived , by Colonel Walter , than herself .
</p>
<p>
I then proceeded to relate , with the utmost exactness , the Colonel 's whole behaviour , from his first meeting , to his <page type="Page 263"/> quitting me , during the recital of which , she wept often ; her countenance became more placid and composed ; and , when I had finished my story , she asked my pardon , a thousand times , for the injury she had done me , and confessed I was much more to be pitied than herself , on account of my youth and inexperience .
</p>
<p>
She confessed too , that the formalities of marriage had never passed between them ; but shewed me a paper he had given her , by which he had engaged to acknowledge her as his wife , at some future aera .
And with regard to the marked attention which he had shewn to me , he assured her he meant nothing more by it , than merely to deceive her mother - and in order to carry on the plot , said he was obliged to spend a few weeks at <page type="Page 264"/> Embrun , upon a particular business , and desired her to hold herself in readiness to come off to him there , at a minute 's warning , on a summons which he promised to send her from thence .
</p>
<p>
Matters being thus settled between them , her mind , she said , was quite at ease on his departure - till she heard of my elopement with him , the morning after it happened ; which threw her into a state of distraction , for several months ; but not hearing from him , all that time , and beginning , at last , to apprehend that her situation would quickly discover her misconduct , and cover her with infamy , she determined to follow him to Embrun ; and as she could not suppose that he had ventured to have entered into firmer engagements with me , than he had already <page type="Page 265"/> done with her , she considered herself as having a prior right to the title of his wife , and resolved to assert her claim .
</p>
<p>
She then took a small sum of money from her mother , to whom , at length , she had revealed the secret , and came off post to Embrun , as it had been known that we had taken that route ; but upon missing us there , she had with almost incredible difficulty , and after numberless delays , attended by illness and fatigue on the way , traced us to Marseilles , where she acknowledged that she owed her life to my unmerited humanity - she then poured forth many severe excecrations against Colonel Walter , said she would not return to BrianÁon , but , if she should recover , would pursue him all over the world , till she had received satisfaction , <page type="Page 266"/> at least in revenge , for his perjured faith and villainy .
</p>
<p>
She told me that my aunt had not expressed either rage or surprise at my going off , but seemed rather to be sufficiently consoled for my loss , by being freed from the expence of my future maintenance .
- There is a material difference between the belief , and certainty of a fact - and though I had hitherto supposed that her insensibility might have prevented her from grieving at the impropriety of my conduct , or the misfortunes which might probably attend it , I could not bear to be convinced of my own insignificance , by her inhumanity - I felt humbled and mortified , at this account , as if I had received some fresh injury .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 267"/> Before I knew any thing of Madame de Fribourg , I had many times thought of returning to BrianÁon , of throwing myself at my only surviving parent 's feet , and of endeavouring to obtain her pardon , for my offending self , and her protection for my unoffending child .
- But now the idea vanished like a dream , and I thought of no other resource , but the marchioness 's kindness .
</p>
<p>
After having discharged all my little debts , I had about thirteen Louis-d'ors left , and the day before I quitted Marseilles , I took leave of Nannette , and presented her with ten of them ; I begged to hear from her , and left a line recommending her to the care of the good Father Guilaume , and we parted from each <page type="Page 268"/> other with all the tokens and feelings of revived friendship .
</p>
<p>
When the Marchioness 's equipage stopped at my door , I was ready to step into it , and my little girl was consigned to the care of her woman , who travelled in a chaise behind us - Madame de Fribourg accosted me with great good-humour , and praised my exactness , in not keeping her waiting .
The instant I opened my lips to reply to her politeness , Monsieur de Lovain lifted up his eye-lids , which had been closed before , and seemed to awake from a profound slumber ; he gazed at me with an expression of surprise in his look , and threw me into as much confusion as his lady had done on out first interview .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 269"/> From that moment he became lively , and so perfectly polite , and attentive to the Marchioness , that not only she , but I was charmed with his behaviour , and our long journey was rendered perfectly agreeable by the pleasing concord that appeared between , as I then thought , this happy pair .
</p>
<p>
On our arrival at Paris , the marchioness allotted me an apartment , in her hotel , and ordered two of her women to attend particularly on me , and my child ; she requested that I would get the better of my air triste , and appointed a music-master and a dancing-master to instruct and fashion me .

AS I have now happily set the fair narrator down safe , at the hotel de Fribourg , you will give us both leave to rest ourselves , a little ; for though I am still , you perceive , running on , yet I find that a change of subjects relieves the fatigue of writing .
</p>
<p>
While she was relating her story , I felt infinitely more than you can possibly do in reading it ; the seeing the very object of distress before us , is a vast improvement to the pathetic ; besides that along with my compassion towards her , and my resentment against her husband , there was mixed up a certain sensation of horror <page type="Page 271"/> at being lodged under the roof of such a villain .
</p>
<p>
I honour Shakespeare , for asking by the mouth of Lear , ' `` Can there be any cause in nature for these hard hearts ? '' '
And am charmed with Sadi , the great Indian philosopher , for saying that Il ne faut qu'un soupir de l'innocence opprimée , pour remeur le monde .
The extravagance of the eastern manner of expression can not hurt the nobleness of the sentiment .
</p>
<p>
We have heard nothing from any of the party since they left us , nor have we been encumbered with neighbourly visits , since our return home - But our weather is fair , our woods are dry , our hearth and hearts are warm , and Harriet , Lucy , and I , find sufficient society <page type="Page 272"/> in ourselves , to shorten the day and lengthen the evening , being too loth to part at night .
</p>
<p>
The next post I shall resume my narrative , which may serve to divert us both from too close an attention to our own unhappiness - Till then ,
</p>
<p>
Adieu ,

<p>
THE HISTORY OF LADY BARTON .
</p>
<p>
Southfield .
</p>
<p>
MY story is already prefaced ; so I need but proceed , repeating as before , after Mrs. Walter .
</p>
<p>
For the first ten or twelve days that I passed at Paris , the novelty of the scene , with the grandeur and brilliancy of the objects that surrounded me , lifted me , as it were , out of myself , and helped me for that time almost to forget my misfortunes .
The marchioness made me several very <page type="Page 2"/> considerable presents , and ordered her trade 's people to attend me , that I might chuse my own cloaths , only desiring they might be handsome enough to appear in along with her .
</p>
<p>
Madame de Fribourg received a vast deal of company , and kept very late hours ; monsieur de Lovaine was seldom of her parties , and sometimes withdrew himself intirely from the house , for a fortnight together ; she used to appear dissatisfied at his absence , and frequently complained to me of the coldness and constraint of his manners towards her .
- He used sometimes , to visit me , in my apartment , seemed fond of my little Olivia , and often wished that he had such another child - He said the marchioness 's mode of living , was by much too gay and <page type="Page 3"/> dissipated for him , and that he languished for the pleasures of society in a more rational course of life .
</p>
<p>
Small as was my knowlege of the world , I could not help perceiving that there was something particular in monsieur de Lovaine 's address , whenever he spoke to me ; but this circumstance , however , was not of a nature to give offence , as it amounted to nothing more than an additional softness , in his looks and voice .
</p>
<p>
The marchioness certainly perceived it as well as I , and would often fix her piercing eyes upon me , and ask me if Colonel Walter was as handsome as monsieur de Lovaine ?
I always replied , as I really thought , that the Colonel was by far the handsomest man I had ever <page type="Page 4"/> seen - She used to appear pleased with what she called my simplicity - At other times her manners were severe towards me ; and , though perfectly convinced of my own innocence , I began soon to fear that I was become the object of her jealousy .
</p>
<p>
This idea was productive of the most fatal consequences to my peace ; it rendered my behaviour timid and constrained , before her , and totally deprived me of that ease and chearfulness which I had before endeavoured to assume , in hopes of rendering myself agreeable to my kind benefactress - This alteration in me , which her own manners had occasioned , she construed into the effect of guilt , and became every day more cold and reserved towards me , <page type="Page 5"/> scarce ever asked me to go out with her , and as often affected to be surprised , when she saw me come into her drawing-room .
</p>
<p>
Though my situation with the marchioness was by no means the ne plus ultra of my hopes and wishes , which continually pressed forward to the meeting of Olivia 's father , my still loved , cruel husband !
yet certainly I had reason to consider it as an happy asylum for my child , and me ; her bounty had rescued both of us from the iron hand of poverty , and placed us in the lap of plenty , of honour , and of ease !
How then could I bear the being suspected of repaying such benefits with the basest sort of ingratitude !
It was impossible !
I determined , therefore , to come to an explanation <page type="Page 6"/> with the marchioness , if possible ; to convince her of my innocence , and do all in my power to recover her esteem ; but if I failed of removing her suspicions , I firmly resolved to quit her directly , to throw myself and my infant once more into a merciless world , to labour for our bread , and suffer any misery that poverty could afflict me with , rather than that of embittering her life , to whom I owed the generous support of my own .
</p>
<p>
I had revolved this subject in my thoughts for several days , and impatiently waited for an opportunity of executing my scheme , but the distance and hauteur of madame de Fribourg 's manner , overawed me still .
I found I could not muster up spirit sufficient to speak <page type="Page 7"/> to her on such an interesting topic , and I resolved , therefore , to communicate my sentiments to her in writing .
</p>
<p>
One evening that she went to the Italian comedy , I retired to my chamber , in order to execute my purpose ; and , that I might not be interrupted , I desired the maid who attended Olivia , to take her down stairs and amuse her , till I should ring for her to come up , as I had some letters of consequence to write - She withdrew , I bolted my chamber door , sat down to the task I had assigned myself - I found it infinitely more difficult than I had imagined ; I wrote , and burned several sheets of paper , and blotted , others , with my tears .
</p>
<p>
In this situation , I heard a key turn , as it were behind the arras , and saw <page type="Page 8"/> monsieur de Lovaine entering by a door which had been till then concealed from me .
I started up , when he threw himself , instantly , at my feet , said he had long waited in vain for the opportunity of finding me alone , for a moment , and hoped I would pardon his acquainting me , perhaps , a little too abruptly , with a secret on which more than his life , his happiness , depended - to be short , he then declared his love for me , with all the asseverations , protestations , and transports , that the most violent passion could suggest .
</p>
<p>
No words can paint the surprise and confusion of my mind , which I thought it was impossible to augment , till I saw the marchioness come in at the door which monsieur de Lovaine had left open , <page type="Page 9"/> and find him on his knees before me .
Luckily for me , I was saved from distraction , by the total suspension of all my faculties ; and I sunk motionless in my chair .
</p>
<p>
Many hours passed , before my reason returned - My recollection of the events that had happened on the preceding night , was such as one feels on awaking from a painful dream ; yet I flattered myself I should still be able to undeceive the marchioness , by the most solemn assurances of my innocence , and though I could never hope to regain her favour , justice methought ought to have restored me to the place I had before obtained in her esteem - Alas !
I knew not then that jealousy , like the adder , is at once sharpsighted , deaf , and venomous .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 10"/> I rose as soon as it was day , and upon inquiring for the papers which I left upon my table , was informed that the marchioness had taken them away - I waited impatiently for her rising , I was determined to throw myself at her feet , the moment I should be permitted to see her , to acquaint her with every sentiment of my heart , and to set hers at ease , on my account , by withdrawing myself from her 's , and monsieur de Lovaine 's sight , for ever .
</p>
<p>
While I was ruminating on my unhappy situation , a servant brought me the following letter .
</p>
<p>
A Madame D'OLIVET .
</p>
<p>
AFTER the scene I was last night an accidental witness of , you can not , I <page type="Page 11"/> suppose , be weak enough to imagine that it is any longer in your power to impose upon me ; or that all your art , consummate as it is , can prevail on me to continue my protection to the most ungrateful of her sex !
Your deep-laid scheme of deceiving me , by that letter , which you and my unworthy husband had concerted together , can not now take effect ; contempt must follow such a detection , and render you as much below my resentment , as you ever were beneath my esteem .
</p>
<p>
In regard to myself , I must inform you , that though I have long suspected an improper intercourse between monsieur de Lovaine and you , I was not actuated by so mean a motive as seeking the conviction I met with , when I entered <page type="Page 12"/> your apartment - Impelled by the regard I once had for you , I was impatient to acquaint you with what I then imagined might have been a welcome piece of intelligence , by informing you , that the person you call your husband , is in Paris , and that I had seen him at the Comedie .
</p>
<p>
It did not , at that moment , occur to me , how unwelcome both the news , and the messenger might be to you .
- On inquiring for you when I came home , I was told that you had bolted your door , and given orders not to be disturbed , even by your darling child ; I knew not but you might be ill , or gone to bed , and therefore , to avoid alarming you , thought of the private door , which your lover had been so careless as to leave <page type="Page 13"/> open behind him .
- I do not mean this detail as an apology to you , but as a justification to myself .
</p>
<p>
I have nothing farther to add , because I must suppose it unnecessary to command you to quit my house ; your new protector will , I doubt not , furnish you with proper accommodation ; and from this moment I am determined never to hear , see , speak , or if possible think of you , more .
</p>
<p>
MARIANA DE FRIBOURG .
</p>
<p>
I sat down , on the instant , and wrote to the marchioness , and , in the strongest and most affecting terms , implored her to admit me to her presence , for a few minutes - but in vain ; she returned my letter unopened , with a message by her woman , <page type="Page 14"/> that she would never read a line that I should write , or ever suffer me into her presence more .
</p>
<p>
I grew almost distracted at this treatment , and tried to force my way into her apartment , but was prevented from entering by her servants , and treated like what I really then was , a poor frantic wretch !
</p>
<p>
The consciousness of my integrity might possibly have supported my spirits , at any other time , but the terrors I felt , lest the marchioness should see my husband before I did , and poison his mind with her unjust suspicions , were not to be endured - My situation was as completely miserable , as any thing , but guilt , could possibly have rendered it .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 15"/> While I laboured under these agonizing sensations , monsieur de Lovaine entered my apartment - The moment I beheld him , rage , for the first time of my life , became the predominant passion of my soul .
I accused him as the author of all my wretchedness , would not suffer him to speak , though he was prostrate at my feet , and commanded him to fly from my sight for ever - Unwilling to irritate me farther , he rose and retired ; and had there been an instrument of death within my reach , I fear I might at that instant have put an end to a wretched being , which saw itself marked out for destruction .
</p>
<p>
I was at last informed by the marchioness 's orders , that a fiacre waited to carry me where I pleased .
- Though I had <page type="Page 16"/> been near ten months at Paris , I was as much a stranger in that great city , as on the day I first arrived there .
I implored the servant who had attended Olivia , not to forsake me , and to direct whither I should go , and what course I should take !
She applied to her lady for leave to attend me , but she had not humanity sufficient to grant her request .
- The girl had , however , resolution and compassion enough to disobey her commands , and accompanied me to a small house in the suburbs of St. Germains , that belonged to her sister .
</p>
<p>
As soon as she had brought me there , she returned again to the hotel de Fribourg , without my knowledge , to pack up my cloaths , and her own - When she came back , she gave me a <page type="Page 17"/> pocket book , which she said I had left behind me ; as soon as I saw it , I knew it was not mine , and desired she would find the owner , and restore it - She opened it , and a letter dropped out , addressed to me - the hand appeared to be the marchioness 's , and it occurred to me that she might have so far relented , as to acquaint me with what she knew of Colonel Walter - I instantly broke the seal , and read as follows .
</p>
<p>
A Madame D'OLIVET .
</p>
<p>
MADAM , if , as we are taught to believe , penitence may atone for the greatest crimes , the true sorrow and contrition which I feel for having rendered you unhappy , entitles me to hope for your forgiveness - But though you should be generous enough to grant it , it is <page type="Page 18"/> impossible that I should ever forgive myself .
- Do not be alarmed , madam , at the little artifice I have used , in endeavouring to counterfeit the marchioness 's hand ; I mean nothing more by it , than to plead for pardon , and to satisfy you that I shall never more attempt to disturb your peace .
</p>
<p>
The moment I have sealed this , I shall quit Paris , perhaps for ever - The sight of my tyrant , is now become odious to me , and I dare not flatter myself with the happiness of ever again beholding you .
I go , then , Madam , to indulge my unhappy passion in silence , and retirement - I fly from the object of my hatred , to the contemplation of her whom I adore , of her to whom the warmest wishes of my heart , shall for <page type="Page 19"/> ever be devoted , and to whom I shall for ever remain
</p>
<p>
a passionate , but an honourable lover , CHARLES DE LOVAINE .
</p>

P.S. I hear the happy possessor of your heart , is now in Paris ; may your virtues meet with their return from his kindness !
and may he , if possible , have as high a sense of them , as the despairing

Enclosed in this letter there was a bank note , for two hundred louis d'ors , which I immediately sealed up with it , and sent Maria to deliver back into the hands of monsieur de Lovaine ; but he had quitted the marchioness 's house , an <page type="Page 20"/> hour before that time , and no person could tell where he was gone to .
</p>
<p>
The violent agitation of spirits I had gone through brought on a feverish complaint , and though I had resolved to go , alas !
I knew not where , in pursuit of Colonel Walter , I found myself unable to sit up , and was obliged to submit to my disorder - I grew worse every hour , and by the next morning I became delirious - The physician who attended me , thought it was impossible that I should recover , and at the end of six weeks , my being able to crawl across the chamber was deemed a prodigy .
</p>
<p>
The anxiety of my mind , doubtless retarded my recovery ; my impatience to see Colonel Walter , or at least to hear <page type="Page 21"/> something of him , increased every day ; and Maria 's sister was sent to inquire for him , at all the hotels , and houses of English resort , in Paris , but without ever receiving the least glimmering of light to trace him by .
</p>
<p>
As soon as my strength would permit , I was carried in a sedan to the Luxemburg gardens ; Maria attended , that I might lean on her , in case I should be able to walk .
- I was moving slowly on , in one of the most retired walks , when I heard Colonel Walter 's voice ; I turned quick to look for him , and saw him coming towards me , with another gentleman - But I saw no more , my senses forsook me ; in spite of Maria 's sustaining arm , I fell motionless on the ground .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 22"/> The first emotions of humanity naturally brought both these persons to my assistance , the colonel raised me in his arms , and carried me to the next seat ; but the moment he beheld my face , he started from me , and cried out , Come away , my lord , and leave that abandoned woman to practise her arts on other men , for here they can not be successful .
</p>
<p>
He then took hold of his companion , dragged him off , and quitted the gardens with the utmost precipitation - And though Maria had sense enough to know that this must have been the person we had so long been in search of , yet it was impossible for her to quit me , in the situation I then was , in order to pursue and watch his haunts .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 23"/> This last shock quite overcame my spirits ; I was conveyed home in a state of insensibility , fell from one fainting fit into another , and for several weeks my existence was marked only by the hourly expectation of my dissolution - Yet was I at that time more anxious to live , than I had ever been before ; I had seen my husband , and hoped there was a possibility of seeing him again , of clearing my innocence , and at least of placing my beloved child under the protection of her father !
These were strong motives , and they operated accordingly - I recovered , to the amazement of every creature that knew me ; and again vainly renewed my search after my unkind fugitive .
</p>
<p>
Maria used sometimes to visit a favourite fellow-servant at the marchionness 's , <page type="Page 24"/> who told her it was universally believed in the family , that I had had an amour with Monsieur de Lovaine ; that he had entirely absented himself from his lady ; and that she seemed inclined to console herself for his loss , by a particular intimacy with an English gentleman , who made one in all her parties , and was going with her in a few days , to the waters of Barege - The description she gave of his person exactly resembled Conel Walter , and I was perfectly convinced that this new friend of the marchioness 's was my still beloved , deceived , and unkind husband !
</p>
<p>
I had no person to consult , who was capable of advising me how I should act upon this occasion ; and amidst a variety of wild and romantic schemes , I at last <page type="Page 25"/> pitched on that of writing to him , and requesting the favour of an interview , in the character of a stranger .
I had no doubt that if he accepted my invitation , nature would recover her rights in his heart ; and that the sight of a woman whom he had once fondly loved , and cruelly deserted , with the additional influence of his lovely child , would melt his obdurate nature , or at least soften it so far as to allow me to assert my innocence , and endeavour to awaken the feelings of parental affection , if every other species of tenderness were even totally extinguished .
</p>
<p>
Full of these fond ideas , I wrote to him in an ambiguous stile , disguised my hand as much as possible , and would not even venture to direct my letter , lest the recollection of my writing , which is rather <page type="Page 26"/> particular , should prevent his opening it .
- Maria prevailed on her friend , who lived at the marchioness 's , to deliver this billet to his servant , and to desire that the answer might be left with her .
</p>
<p>
Every thing answered to my expectations , and , the morning following , I received a very galant note , assuring me that the person I had honoured with my invitation , would most gladly accept of the favour I intended him , and have the happiness of waiting on me , at eight o'clock that evening .
</p>
<p>
My poor foolish heart exulted with joy , at the success of my little stratagem .
I dressed and undressed Olivia , an hundred times , in order to try if I could add any ornament to her natural beauty , and <page type="Page 27"/> render her more lovely in her father 's eyes - as to myself I disdained the aid of dress , well knowing that my wan complexion , and my wasted form , could only furnish him with such a reproachful idea as my ghost might have done , of what I was when he forsook me .
</p>
<p>
I counted the minutes quicker than they passed , and thought them ages , till the appointed hour arrived - but , gracious Heaven !
how shall I express the astonishment I felt , when I saw an utter stranger enter the room , with a mixture of libertinism and freedom , in his looks and manners ; I let go Olivia 's hand , which I had held in mine , gave a loud shriek , and fainted .
</p>
<p>
Maria ran to my assistance , the stranger gazed intently on me , and said to her , <page type="Page 28"/> with a kind of sneer , it was a pity that her lady was subject to such violent disorders , but hoped she would recover her health before she made another assignation with him ; for he had seen her faint twice , and he did not think fits were the least addition to female beauty - However , as he believed she might be in distress , he would make her a present of five guineas , for the sake of an old friend of her 's , honest Jack Walter - and that when he came back from Barege , he would call upon her again , in hopes of finding her in a more sociable state than she appeared to be , at present .
</p>
<p>
Maria instantly recollected that this gentleman was with the Colonel , the day we met him in the Luxemburg gardens , and endeavoured to convince him , that <page type="Page 29"/> he was not the person I expected to see : he said that was impossible , for he had my note in his pocket , and had shewn it to Colonel Walter , who knew my writing perfectly well , though I had attempted to disguise it .
- She tried every argument to make him take back his money , but in vain ; and as he found that I did not immediately come to myself , he quitted the house , with strong expressions of dissatisfaction at his disappointment .
</p>
<p>
This last stroke was infinitely more severe than all that I had yet endured ; I now saw the impossibility of ever clearing my conduct to my husband , and devoted as I was , by him , to infamy , the peaceful asylum of the sheltering grave was now become my only hope , or wish ; <page type="Page 30"/> even a mother 's tenderness could not reconcile me to such unmerited and endless sufferings ; that virtuous fondness which had sustained me through all my former trials , was now absorbed in mean self-love , and I could not refrain from praying for an end of my misery , though certain that my Olivia 's misfortunes must commence from the conclusion of mine .
</p>
<p>
I languished on , for many months , in this state of passive despair , when the fight of the good father Guillaume , whom I had never heard from since I left Marseilles , and of course concluded to be dead , brought back a gleam of joy .
</p>
<p>
He told me that after his return to Marseilles , he had a long and severe illness , and on his recovery had been obliged <page type="Page 31"/> to go to Rome , on business ; that he had written to me , several times , and was grieved to find that his letters had miscarried .
- He informed me , that Nannette had died , in about six weeks after I left her ; that she was extremely penitent for the injuries she had done me ; and retracted every thing she had said to my prejudice - I dropped tears at her untimely fate - while my own misery taught me to envy that lot , which my humanity lamented .
</p>
<p>
The marchioness had written to father Guillaume , and accused me of the basest ingratitude to her , and the most infamous conduct with regard to myself ; and the good man had come on purpose , to Paris , to be , as he said , convinced of my innocence , or to relinquish his opinion <page type="Page 32"/> of female virtue .
The situation he found me in , afforded him sufficient conviction of my integrity ; and when I related the circumstances in which I had been involved , the gracious drops of pity that he shed for my distress , were like a healing balm to my poor wounded heart .
</p>
<p>
He would have gone directly to the marchioness , and tried to undeceive her , but she had been at Barege , for some time , and no one knew whether she would go from thence to Paris , or Marseilles .
- He undertook to find out Colonel Walter for me , if he remained in Paris ; and cheared my spirits with the hope that he would at least vindicate my injured character , and leave him no excuse for the inhumanity of his behaviour .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 33"/> After a fruitless search of several weeks , he learned that Colonel Walter was then at Genoa - He wrote to him , in the most forcible terms , in my favour ; but to this , and many other letters , he never deigned an answer , though we were satisfied that he had received them from the hand of a person that Father Guillaume could depend on ; who afterwards informed us of the Colonel 's setting out for England , and of his design of returning to settle in his native country .
</p>
<p>
As to myself , I had now no hope left of ever recovering his esteem , or my reputation - To my great joy I perceived I was going fast into a consumption ; but though I longed for my release , it was impossible to quit my little charge exposed to all the miseries of unfriended <page type="Page 34"/> youth , without suffering the severest agonies ; and after many consultations , upon the subject , I at last acquiesced in Father Guillaume 's opinion , that it was my duty not to leave her totally an orphan , but to place her and myself under the protection of her father , before I should be taken from her .
</p>
<p>
Upon this principle I set out for Ireland , as soon as I had received information , through Father Guillaume 's means , of my husband 's being there .
I arrived about four months ago : my reception surpassed even my apprehensions !
inhumanity and insult were added to unkindness , and my not being turned out to perish in the highway , was accounted a favour far beyond my desert .
- What account the Colonel gave of me to his servants , I <page type="Page 35"/> can only suppose ; but he told me that if ever I attempted to converse with one of them , I should not remain another moment in his house ; he commanded me never again to appear in his sight , and confined me to a wretched garret , where I am supplied with such food as his servants think proper to afford me .
</p>
<p>
Unworthy as I am , I have often repined at the continuance of my existence ; but I now bless the chastening hand that has enabled me to support my miseries to this auspicious hour ; when I can no longer doubt that my child shall find protection from your humanity , and no more be involved in the unhappy fate that has so long attended her truly wretched mother !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 36"/> The agonies which Mrs. Walter sustained , during the recital of her affecting story , made me fear that her death would bring it to a period , before she had finished the relation - But my appearing , as I really was , sincerely interested in her misfortunes , seemed to furnish her with such a recruit of strength and spirits , as enabled her to undergo the reflection and recital of her unmerited sorrows .
</p>
<p>
The morning was pretty far advanced , by the time Mrs. Walter had concluded her narrative ; I gave her the strongest assurances of my doing every thing in my power , both for herself , and her child - I pressed her to take share of my bed , for a few hours , which she refused , though she seemed so faint and exhausted , as to be scarce able to get up stairs .
She said , <page type="Page 37"/> if Olivia should awaken and miss her , she would be alarmed , and might disturb the family .
She added that one of her greatest anxieties , for some time past , had been for what her child should feel , if she should happen to expire in the night , and that the little helpless innocent should find her cold and insensible to her soft touch and voice !
</p>
<p>
As soon as she left me , I went to bed , but found it impossible to rest - I knew not in what manner to act ; Sir William would probably be displeased at my interfering in Colonel Walter 's affairs , yet was I determined , at all events , to fulfil my promise to this amiable unfortunate , and protect her and her child , as far as it might be in my power !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 38"/> With this resolution I shall now take leave of my dearest Fanny , as I am extremely fatigued with writing ; yet would not trespass so far on your patience , as to break off again , till I had concluded Mrs Walter 's story .
- But , interested as I am for her , be assured that I am much more so for my beloved Fanny , and Sir George .
</p>
<p>
Where is he now , my sister ?
has Mrs. Colville 's mystery been explained ?
is his heart more at ease after it ?
and has your 's yet recovered that tranquility , which should be the portion of the good and amiable ?
Alas !
why is it not unalienably so ?
Yet Mrs Walter wastes her days in sorrow , my Fanny mourns her ill-requited love , Sir George hangs pensive o'er his Delia 's tomb , and my sad heart , too much in unison with mournful tones , <page type="Page 39"/> responsive echoes back the sighs of all , and mingles plaintive notes for its own woes !
</p>
<p>
Adieu , my dearest sister ,
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
A Thousand thanks to my dear Louisa , for the pleasing painful entertainment which she has taken the trouble of affording me - which is at present more particularly suited to my situation , than any other that could possibly be devised .
</p>
<p>
In quest of happiness we should for ever cast our eyes downward , and the <page type="Page 40"/> tears that flow from them , in contemplating the miseries of those who are more wretched than ourselves , will at elast stifle the voice of self-love , and silence the complaints that arise from lesser sorrows - sometimes imaginary ones .
</p>
<p>
When I compare my sufferings with those of the unfortunate Olivia , I am shocked at my own ingratitude and impiety , for having ever dared to say I was unhappy !
The greatest misery I have endured , falls infinitely short of the least of hers .
-
</p>
<p>
Like her , I have been forsaken by the man I love ; but then I have not , like her , been exposed to want and ignominy .
Sheltered in the fostering arms of tender and affectionate friends , who sympathize <page type="Page 41"/> even with my weakness in lamenting an inconstant lover , blessed with reputation , health , and fortune - these circumstances render the comparison so very unfair , that it must be disadvantageous to make it .
No , she is alone the paragon of unearned sufferings ; and I hope there is not any one person living who has a right to dispute the ' `` painful preeminence '' ' with her .
-
</p>
<p>
But where is she , now , Louisa ?
It is not possible that you can have left her in that Pandaemonium , which the great fiend inhabits !
I can not speak of Colonel Walter in milder terms .
I am provoked that the infernal should have any shadow of pretence , for his barbarity to his angelic wife .
- When the world once gets hold of a tale of scandal , is it not easy <page type="Page 42"/> to wrest it from them .
- That wicked marchioness - but there will be no end to my letter , if I go on entering into particulars .
</p>
<p>
All I can say upon the whole , is this , that I fear your bringing her to Southfield may engage Sir William in a strife , either with the Colonel , or yourself : no one can tell which part ; he will take , I should rather apprehend his siding with the monster , and quarrelling with you for intermeddling .
</p>
<p>
To avoid all this apprehension , if Mrs. Walter be able to bear the journey , on the easiest terms it can be made to her , request you to send her and her child over to me , as quick as possible .
I will receive her with open arms , and do <page type="Page 43"/> every thing in my power to procure her health , and peace : I have no person to whom I am accountable for my conduct , and therefore stand clearer from difficulty in this affair than you do .
</p>
<p>
I hope these reasons will incline both Mrs. Walter and you to comply with my entreaty , and that I shall soon have the happiness of embracing the two lovely Olivias .
- She may depend on my secrecy : I can prepare this family , in half an hour , for the reception of a lady and her daughter from France , whom I have invited to spend some time with me ; I will carry her to Bristol , or any other place that may aid her recovery - She must not die Louisa ; and , for Heaven 's sake , let me have the happiness of being concerned in her preservation .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 44"/> I fear self his predominated too much in this wish , for indeed I look forward with an uncommon degree of impatience , to the pleasure of having it in my power to serve such an amiable creature - Do , my Louisa , then , indulge me with the true enjoyment of the fortune I am possessed of - Let me know the transport of succouring merit in distress , and I shall henceforward look upon riches as a real blessing !
</p>
<p>
I have this moment received a letter from our dear brother , that has amazed me .
- What think you is the pretended request of the dying Delia ?
Why nothing more , than that Sir George should marry her mother !
I have long suspected her passion for my brother ; I knew her to be an artful , that is , in other words , <page type="Page 45"/> a vile woman !
I can not help the evil thoughts which obtrude themselves on my mind , with regard to my dear Delia 's death - If Mrs. Colville be innocent , Heaven forgive me !
- But I have not charity enough to pray for her , if she should be guilty .
</p>
<p>
Sir George does not express half the horror that I feel at this shocking proposal !
the gratification which our vanity receives in knowing we are beloved , even by the most worthless person , can , I perceive , soften our contempt into compassion , and deceive us so far as to make us think such pity the offspring of our virtue - However , do not be alarmed ; for though he speaks somewhat too tenderly of her pretended sorrow , I am certain no power on earth could ever make <page type="Page 46"/> him think of such an unnatural alliance .
</p>
<p>
I have little to say of myself ; nothing of moment has happened to me since I wrote last ; and I endeavour to think as little as possible , of what happened before .
- Adieu , my dear Louisa !
I hope there is a letter of yours now travelling towards me , for I am most extremely impatient to know what you have done , or intend to do , with Mrs. Walter .
I beg you to assure her of my affectionate regard , and to believe me ever
</p>
<p>
most truly yours , F. CLEVELAND ,
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 47"/> Southfield .
</p>
<p>
THIS letter , my Fanny , shall go on in the narrative stile , at least so far as it relates to Mrs. Walter ; for as her adventures are intirely detached from any thing relative to us , I will not mingle them with mine .
</p>
<p>
I lay till it was very late , on the morning that the fair unfortunate had related her story , yet I had neither slept , nor fixed upon any scheme for delivering her from her hated prison , except that of bringing her and her child to Southfield , which I foresaw must be attended with very hazardous consequences ; <page type="Page 48"/> I therefore summoned a little council , the moment I arose , and after communicating the most distressful circumstances of her situation to Lucy , Harriet , and my faithful Benson , I desired them to give me their advice how to act , on this critical occasion ; having first informed them , that I was determined not to desert the cause I had undertaken , by leaving this amiable woman to perish at Waltersburgh .
</p>
<p>
Various , as you may suppose , were the plans offered and rejected - It was at last agreed , that we should return home as soon as possible ; and that Mrs. Walter should remain where she was , for three or four days after our departure ; that , in that time , Benson should be employed in fitting up a chamber for her <page type="Page 49"/> reception in the house of one of our tenants , whom I formerly mentioned to you , as having his house burned , and who had now got a very comfortable , though small , habitation , within a short walk of Southfield ; that as soon as every thing was prepared , Benson should come for her in my chaise , to a particular spot , at a time appointed , and convey her and the little Olivia to this house , where she was to remain in profound secrecy , till we saw what effect this innocent elopement might produce , till every thing in our power should have been done for the recovery of her health , and till we could fix upon some more eligible plan for her future happiness .
</p>
<p>
As the Colonel 's servants gave themselves not the least trouble about the fair <page type="Page 50"/> recluse , we found it very easy to convey proper food to her , unobserved ; and as I thought it right that she should have time to consider of our scheme , I wrote to her directly , and desired to have the pleasure of another interview with her , in my apartment , that night .
- I gave her to understand , in the politest manner I could , my reasons for declining to bring her directly to Southfield , at least till I had consulted my husband ; and assured her in the strongest terms , that while I lived , neither she , or her child , should ever be reduced to the misery of seeking support or protection from the inhuman Colonel Walter .
I added every thing that I thought could soothe her mind , and implored her to take care of her health , for the sake of her lovely infant .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 51"/> She replied almost instantly to my letter , poured forth the warmest acknowledgments for my goodness , again called me her guardian angel , and said she was ready to be guided by me in every thing ; and that , as the strongest mark of her gratitude , she would at my command endeavour to live , were it only to bless and thank me !
</p>
<p>
The impatience of Lucy and Harriet to see Mrs. Walter was extreme ; they looked at their watches an hundred times , and would fain have persuaded themselves they did not , go from the moment it grew dusk till our hour of retiring ; though it was yet a moot point , whether they were to see her or no , as I meant first to ask her permission , certainly , before I should present them to her .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 52"/> When she entered my apartment , her countenance seemed at once more animated and composed than it had been the preceding night - the effusions of her gratitude were such as must flow from a heart like hers , and were more fully expressed by the silent eloquence of tears , than by the pomp of words - She readily and most gracefully complied with the request I made her , of giving me leave to introduce Lucy and Harriet to her ; who , notwithstanding the description I had given them of the delicacy and elegance of her form , were both amazed when they beheld her , and could hardly consider her as of flesh and blood , but rather a form of unsubstantial air , or else composed of that fine ether with which we suppose angels indue themselves , when they deign to become visible on earth .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 53"/> As both Mrs. Walter and I wanted rest , we parted sooner than we had done the foregoing night , after having first settled every thing for the execution of our project , and fixed on the day following for my quitting Waltersburg .
Benson packed up a part of hers and Olivia 's cloaths with mine , and we contrived to leave her every little necessary that could be conducive to her comfort or convenience , while she remained behind us .
</p>
<p>
I have now the pleasure to tell you that every thing succeeded to our wishes , and that she and her sweet girl are safely and privately lodged at honest farmer Wilson 's , for the present .
I write to her every day by Benson , but have not yet ventured to see her , as I am not able to walk , and the eclat of my <page type="Page 54"/> carriage stopping at a farm-house , might occasion suspicion .
</p>
<p>
Benson assures me that she already perceives a change for the better in her appearance ; and I begin to hope she may recover both her health and peace of mind .
The little Olivia is quite wild with spirits , and is trying to learn English from Lucy , who visits Mrs. Walter every day , and the first words she desired to be taught , were meant to express her thanks to me for my kindness to her mamma .
</p>
<p>
Though I reflect with sincere pleasure on having been able to rescue this amiable woman from a scene of the severest distress , yet I can not help feeling an anxiety for her future fate , which gives <page type="Page 55"/> me extreme pain - She can not long remain where she is , undiscovered , and no one can tell what step that barbarian , her husband , may take to distress her yet farther - My apprehensions are , that he will force Olivia from her ; and the loss of her child would , I am certain , occasion the loss of her life .
</p>
<p>
But supposing that he should never discover her retreat , or even inquire about her , I see no asylum , except a convent , where her youth and beauty will not subject her to a thousand misfortunes .
- You are sufficiently acquainted [ ... ] ith my sentiments on the subject of monasteries , to know how very unwilling I should be to recommend a state of seclusion to any creature I either love or esteem ; yet , in her unhappy situation , <page type="Page 56"/> I see no other resource - However , I shall not advise precipitately .
</p>
<p>
Not but that I should approve extremely of an establishment of this kind , in our own country , under our own religion and laws ; both equally free from tyranny - An asylum for unhappy women to retreat to - not from the world , but from the misfortunes , or the slander of it - for female orphans , young widows , or still more unhappy objects , forsaken , or ill treated wives , to betake themselves to , in such distresses .
For in all these circumstances , women who live alone , have need of something more than either prudence or a fair character , to guard them from rudeness or censure .
</p>
<p>
Now some sort of foundation , under the government of a respectable matronage , <page type="Page 57"/> endowed for such a purpose , would certainly be an institution most devoutly to be wished for , as a relief in the difficulties of those situations I have just mentioned .
Here women might enjoy all the pleasures and advantages of living still in the world , have their conduct reciprocally vouched by one another , and be screened from those artful and insidious essays , which young or pretty women , when once become helpless adjectives of society , are generally liable to .
</p>
<p>
I have had a letter from Sir William , and for once he seems pleased with my determination of staying in the country .
This has made me very happy - tho ' had he commanded my attendance in Dublin , I would have obeyed ; for I will at least endeavour to deserve the character <page type="Page 58"/> which the offended Moor gives of the gentle Desdemona - ' `` As you say , obedient , - very obedient ! '' '
- and , as I have already told my Fanny , that is all that I can at present promise .
</p>
<p>
I think it is a little century since I have heard from you ; I suppose you did not chuse to interrupt me in my narrative , but I expect , and I think reasonably , that you should now hold forth , in your turn , and allow me credit for the entertainment which I am certain you must have received , from Mrs. Walter 's story .
I have this moment got a card from Miss Ashford , to congratulate me , on my recovery , and to let me know that Lord Lucan and she will wait on me , this afternoon .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 59"/> Is it not odd , Fanny , that I should not have heard of his being at Sir Arthur Ashford 's , till now ?
Perhaps he went there directly from Waltersburgh ; if so , he must certainly be attached to Miss Ashford .
But of what consequence are his engagements to me !
</p>
<p>
I shall not know how to behave to him , uncertain as I am with regard to that unaccountable adventure , at Colonel Walter 's .
- If he is innocent of that insult , he will be astonished at the coldness and distance of my manners towards him ; if guilty , surely his own confusion will betray him , and he shall never see my face again .
</p>
<p>
But why should he bring Miss Ashford with him , to Southfield ?
Does not <page type="Page 60"/> this look as if he feared an explanation ?
Guilty , guilty , upon honour !
</p>
<p>
Adieu , my sister ,
</p>
<p>
LOUISA BARTON .
</p>
<p>
I Have such a variety of subjects to treat of , that I know not which to begin with ; but I think I ought to pay my dear Fanny the compliment of attending first to her long wished-for and truly welcome letter .
</p>
<p>
I had not a doubt but that your humanity would be both affected and interested for the unhappy Mrs. Walter .
The goodness both of your head and heart is eminently conspicious in the proper use <page type="Page 61"/> you have made of her misfortunes .
To lighten and invalidate our own sufferings , by comparing them with those of others , is truly philosophic : but that firmness of mind , or rather toughness of heart , which enables us to bear our own miseries with patience and composure , is , in general , but too apt to render us callous to those tender feelings , which should be excited by the woes of others .
- Let me then congratulate myself on having a sister whose Stoicism is confined only to herself , while her tenderness and compassion are extended to the numerous , the unbounded circle of the unhappy !
</p>
<p>
Yes , my Fanny , your request shall be complied with ; Mrs. Walter is already made happy in the hope of being known to such a generous mind as yours .
<page type="Page 62"/> She has confessed to me , that , in her present situation , she had suffered a thousand apprehensions , lest my kindness to her might involve me in difficulties with Sir William ; but that she could think of no expedient to prevent this evil , but flying to a convent , which she feared to propose , as her going there must be attended with what she thought too considerable an expence .
</p>
<p>
I should have strongly objected to this scheme , from her ill state of health , though she is , however , amazingly recovered , since her enlargement from that worse than prison , where her poor mind was fettered , though her limbs were free - And I have great hopes , from the calm state in which she now appears , of her recovery .
- She has really an extraordinary <page type="Page 63"/> understanding , allowing for her youth and inexperience ; and from that , I trust , that she will be able to conquer the tenderness she formerly felt for the most worthless of his sex .
</p>
<p>
She is to set out this night for Corke , where she is consigned to the care of an eminent merchant , a particular friend of Lucy Leister 's , who will ensure her a passage in one of the best ships that sails from thence to Bristol .
- On her arrival there , she is to be put into the care of Benson 's niece , who is married to a stationer , and is commanded by her aunt to attend her up to London , and lodge her safe under your kind protection .
One of farmer Wilson 's daughters goes with her , to attend the little Olivia - The girl has lived in some creditable families , <page type="Page 64"/> and is tolerably clever - Both Mrs. Walter and her lovely child have made an astonishing progress in learning English ; they have capacities for every thing .
</p>
<p>
When the moment arrives of bidding her adieu , which it shortly must , I shall be sensible of a more mixed sensation than I have ever felt before ; I know that I ought to rejoice at our separation , for her sake ; but I can not help being selfish enough to regret it , for my own .
</p>
<p>
Amazement falls infinitely short of what I felt , when I read the paragraph in your letter relative to Mrs. Colville !
I am shocked as well as you at the train of ideas which obtruded themselves upon me , in consequence of her unnatural proposal - ' `` Alarmed about my brother ! '' '
<page type="Page 65"/> No , Heaven forbid that I should ever think of him in such a light !
He ever disliked , and he must now detest her - But Sir George is of a mild and gentle nature , not apt to give the reins to his resentments ; his natural and acquired good breeding must prevent his speaking hardly of a woman who even pretends to love him ; and the involuntary respect with which he is inspired for Delia 's mother , must increase his restraint , and silence every sarcastical reflection .
</p>
<p>
Now for myself - I know not what to think about Lord Lucan ; never was confusion equal to mine , at seeing him - this rendered me incapable of observing him ; but Lucy , who was present at our interview , assured me there was nothing particular in his appearance , except the <page type="Page 66"/> paleness of his countenance , and his surprise at my manner , which I am sure must have been perfectly distrait .
</p>
<p>
Why did he bring Miss Ashford here ?
She doubtless remarked the alteration in my behaviour ; and I am perhaps , at this moment , the object of their ridicule .
- I never saw her look so handsome as she did that evening - I suppose they will soon be married : I wish it was over , and that they were both gone to his seat in the North .
</p>
<p>
I have been extremely uneasy , these three days , about my little Harriet - she looks ill , and neither eats , or sleeps , yet will not allow that she is sick .
I should certainly apprehend her being in love , if she had seen any object lately , that could have inspired her with that passion .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 67"/> No , my dear Fanny !
my adventure at Waltersburgh was not a dream ; yet I sometimes think with you , that Lord Lucan could never have been guilty of such an indecorum ; tho ' I do not now agree with you , that he is at all affected with any particular sentiment towards me .
And I sincerely rejoice in dissenting from your opinion , on this subject .
</p>
<p>
By sending Mrs. Walter to you , I have barred my own hopes of seeing you in Ireland ; and I , alas !
have none of meeting you , in England - I can not let this effort of generosity pass , without marking it , for perhaps it is the highest exertion of that virtue which I may ever have an opportunity of displaying .
</p>
<p>
I go now to bid adieu to your future charge - She will have the happiness of <page type="Page 68"/> seeing my Fanny , almost as soon as this can reach her hands .
- An involuntary sigh has just escaped me !
Down , selfish thoughts !
</p>
<p>
Farewell , my dear sister
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
I Have received your letter , my Louisa , and I have also received your fair , your lovely friend !
Mrs. Walter arrived in Dover-street last night - Prepared as I was , by your description , the extreme delicacy of her form surpassed my imagination - I can scarcely persuade myself that she is compounded of the same materials of which common mortals are made ; at least I am certain that there <page type="Page 69"/> must be as much difference , as there is between the clay of which the finest porcelain is formed , and that which makes the coarsest earthen-ware .
</p>
<p>
I am sorry to say the simile is strengthened by an appearance of extreme fragility and weakness , which alarms one 's tenderness into a kind of apprehension for her safety , every moment ; and is , in my mind infinitely more interesting , than the most healthful glow of beauty in its highest bloom - I am sure if I were a man , I should be in love with her , and of course miserable , for I could not help considering her but as a mere beauteous shadow , which arough blast too quickly might dissolve - But though not a lover , I am determined to cherish this fair idea , and for that purpose I shall take lodgings <page type="Page 70"/> at Kensington Gravel-pits , tomorrow , for three weeks , or a month ; as I do not think the season far enough advanced , to carry her to the Hot-wells , or venture her even so far as Cleveland-hall .
</p>
<p>
There is , as you have already observed , something uncommonly engaging in her manner of speaking ; but her sentiments need no addition - I never heard such warm , yet elegant expressions of gratitude , as she used in speaking of you ; her tears flowed fast while she uttered them .
The little Olivia took her hand , and said , ' `` Mamma , Lady Barton is so good , that I know it would grieve her to think she made you weep ; for I am sure she meant to dry your tears . '' '
</p>
<p>
But Mrs. Walter is at this moment writing to you , I will therefore leave her <page type="Page 71"/> to express her own sentiments , which she will do much better than I can , because she feels more .
</p>
<p>
I am charmed with your scheme of an English protestant monastery , though I am much afraid that both you wrote , and I read , that passage in your letter , with too selfish feelings and reflections .
The general idea of convents I am as much averse to as you are ; and I am sure that none of those abroad , would be a proper retreat for our fair client - The strictness of their institutions , and the harshness of their discipline , would soon dispatch her to the region of saints .
Besides , such a place would be as unfit for one in her state of mind , as well as of body - Need the already unhappy afflict themselves still further , with austerities ?
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 72"/> There is a paragraph in your letter , which gives me infinite concern : my dear Louisa must no longer boast a heart quite free from love - She is , I am afraid , a stricken deer ; but I will hope that the wound is not mortal , and that it may yet be healed , though not without a cicatrice .
- Why !
- Ask yourself , my sister , why all these apprehensions about Miss Ashford ?
Why is she to be married to Lord Lucan , merely because she came with him to visit you ?
And why should you suspect an amiable young woman of such mean malice , as , without provocation , to attempt to render you ridiculous ?
- These are not the genuine feelings of my Louisa 's heart !
the stings of jealousy have instilled its venom , and this passion has but two sources , pride and love .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 73"/> I most sincerely wish that Lord Lucan and Miss Ashford were married , and that they were gone to his lordship 's seat in the North , or to any other point of the compass that may be most remote from the neighbourhood of Southfield .
</p>
<p>
I can not help trembling for your happiness , Louisa - I well know that I have nothing else to fear for ; but is not that sufficient !
I have , with pain , long beheld your growing partiality for his lordship ; yet I hoped , against the conviction of my own heart , which still overflows with tenderness for an unworthy object , that you would be able to conquer it - But let me here observe , Louisa , that our situations are so widely different , that the weakness which may in mine , not <page type="Page 74"/> only be pardoned , but pitied , becomes criminal in yours .
</p>
<p>
This you may possibly say , is hard measure ; but as we were none of us in a condition to make terms for ourselves , before we came into the world , we must submit to those that this same world has imposed on us since ; and believe me , that they who struggle least against those chains which custom has forged for our sex are least likely to feel their weight .
- The world is jealous of its rites ; it haughtily resents , and harshly chastizes , the smallest breach of them ; nor did I ever know a man or woman , who boasted that they despised its laws , and trusted to their own integrity , who were not soon severely punished by its contempt or censure .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 75"/> So much by way of censor ; now let the friend and sister plead for the preservation of your peace , which can not be maintained with loss of fame , though conscious innocence might plead your justification ever so strongly - Should your character happen to be impeached , from any misconduct of yours , remember that your husband has a right to resent your having forfeited the highest trust which manly confidence can commit to female delicacy , the preservation both of his honour and her own !
and that from that moment you must appear in the light of a criminal , towards him at least , tho ' you stand ever so clear , with regard to yourself .
How truly humiliating must such a situation be , to a mind like yours !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 76"/> I have drawn this sad prospect in the strongest colours , in hopes that my Louisa will start from the brink of the precipice where she now stands , and instantly retreat into the gentle path of domestic happiness .
- I am truly grieved that the roughness of Sir William 's manners may render this walk less smooth and pleasing than it should be ; yet surely it is easier to tread on pebbles than on thorns !
And with the latter we shall certainly find those ways strewed , that lead from the road which Providence has marked out for us .
</p>
<p>
I should detest myself if I were able to add another line on this subject , yet I hope that my tears have not so much blotted what I have already written , as to prevent your reading it .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 77"/> Mrs. Walter is determined to write to her husband , and I think her right in it , for some of the reasons given above ; though Heaven knows she owes him no compliment , nor scarcely duty - She shall not , however , if I can prevent her , write for some days , as it must hurry her poor weak spirits , which want much to be recruited .
</p>
<p>
I have not heard from my brother , for some time .
Adieu ,
</p>
<p>
my ever dear Louisa ,
</p>
<p>
F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 78"/> IF I were not perfectly convinced of the fallacy of judicial astrology , I should fancy you were a conjurer , Lucan ; and that you had calculated Margarita 's nativity - How else could you , at such a distance , discover that she was compounded of art ; while I , who saw her every day , and all the day , was so thoroughly hoodwinked by her beauty , as to imagine her mind as faultless as her form !
What a numscull !
what a coxcomb have I been ?
She had cunning enough to persuade , and I folly enough to believe , that she loved me to distraction - For the rest of my life I shall consider <page type="Page 79"/> myself as an idiot ; though yon are to take notice , that I will not be called so , even by you - But the worst of it is that I am a ruined fool too .
- Do n't laugh , Lucan ; I shall be ready to cut your throat if you do ; but I know you will not , when I tell you that I am severely hurt .
</p>
<p>
In my last I acquainted you , that I had lost a large sum at play , and was waiting at Venice for remittances , which arrived in a few days - Margarita had a mind , as she said , that we should quit Venice with a coup d'eclat , and prevailed on me to hire jewels , to the amount of two thousand pounds , to ornament herself on the last night of our appearance at the carnival .
I readily complied with her request , though I had before laid <page type="Page 80"/> out very near that sum in the same sort of trumpery for her .
</p>
<p>
She looked like an angel when she was dressed , that I must acknowledge ; and I never once thought of searching for the cloven foot , beneath such a dazzling brightness .
</p>
<p>
We went together to the masquerade , and with us a man she called her brother , whom I have since discovered to be her galant , and a notorious sharper .
I soon engaged at play - fortune favoured me , for a time ; but before the conclusion of the night , she was at her old tricks again , and I lost five-hundred guineas .
</p>
<p>
The agitation , naturally attendant on the vicissitudes of play , had taken off <page type="Page 81"/> my attention , even from Margarita , so that I felt no anxiety at not having seen her for several hours .
It was very late when I went home ; and judge of my amazement when I was told she had not returned , from the time we set out together - I flew back again into the street , and ran , like a distracted man , into every house that was open ; but the company were retired from every place , and I could find no trace of her .
</p>
<p>
I will not pretend to give you an idea of my situation , for I can now hardly recollect the state of my mind at that time , much less describe it .
- About nine o'clock in the morning , a Mendicant friar brought a letter to my door , in which were contained these words .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 82"/> To Lord HUME .
</p>
<p>
I intreat you , my dear lord , and quondam lover , not to be uneasy on my account ; I am well , and happy ; and before this can reach you , shall be out of the Venetian dominions ; all search after me will be in vain .
I should not have quitted you so abruptly , if I had not discovered that my staying with you would have been an injury to your fortune , which I imagine is already much hurt - But you Englishmen can always repair such damages by marriage .
- I have therefore removed the only obstacle to the amendment of your circumstances , by tearing myself from you ; and do now most seriously recommend it to you , to return to your own country , and avail yourself of this last resource .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 83"/> Those trifles of yours which I have taken with me , I shall still preserve as tokens of your liberality , which is allowed to be the national virtue of the English : and I shall ever remain your Lordship 's
</p>
<p>
much obliged , and obedient servant M. DEL STRAZZI .
</p>
<p>
The reading of this letter intirely conquered every passion of my mind , but rage ; and I think I could at that moment , have stranged the insolent gypsy who wrote it - But I was not suffered to brood over it long ; for the Jew , from whom I had hired the jewels , came to demand them .
- I knew not what to do ; I had settled with my banker the day before , and as I intended leaving Venice , I had withdrawn my letter of credit , and had <page type="Page 84"/> not half so much cash as would answer the Israelite 's demand .
- Lord Stormont happened luckily to come in , to pay me a visit ; I frankly told him my distress , and he kindly lent me a draft on his banker , which satisfied old Shylock .
</p>
<p>
I wrote on the instant to my agent , to cut down a wood that was planted , for ought I know , by my great-grandfather ; and thus my good tall oaks , that have been at least fourscore years growing , have vanished into the hands of Jews , and jades , for one night 's no diversion at the carnival .
</p>
<p>
Indeed , Lucan , I begin to think that we English are very silly fellows .
But why should I lump my countrymen , when I am really convinced that there is not <page type="Page 85"/> such another noodle in the world , as myself ?
</p>
<p>
How go on your love affairs ?
They ca n't be in such a desperate state as mine .
- Our countrywomen have not spirit enough to strike such a stroke as my Diàvolessa has done , and I now begin to think that a man had better be contented with the wholsome home-brewed beer of old England , than pay too dear for Tokay .
</p>
<p>
Now I talk of England , I should like very well to return there , if I were not ashamed to see Fanny Cleveland , and afraid of being laughed at by my old friends at Almac 's , and Boodle 's , and in short every where .
- Do , my dear Lucan , tell me what I shall do with myself ?
<page type="Page 86"/> for I am at present the most desolate , as well as desultory of mortals .
- But in all states I shall continue affectionately yours ,
</p>
<p>
HUME .
</p>
<p>
My dear Hume ,
</p>
<p>
AS you have made it a point , I will not laugh at what you seem to consider as a misfortune , but you must permit me to say , that I have not received so much pleasure , for a long time , as from your account of Margarita 's elopement .
- Believe me , my friend , you have got cheaply off , even with the loss of some thousands - Character is of infinitely more value than fortune - But I am <page type="Page 87"/> persuaded that both yours would have been totally ruined , had you continued much longer connected with that most infamous and artful woman .
</p>
<p>
There is nothing so very particular in your adventure , as to make you apprehend yourself peculiarly ridiculous ; for I will take upon me to say , that there is not one in ten of our countrymen , that has made the same tour which you have done , who has not been duped by some ' `` Jay of Italy . '' '
- Do n't publish the story yourself , and others will be cautious how they mention it to you .
- I will also venture to promise that Miss Cleveland has too much delicacy herself , to wound yours , though I have not the honour of knowing her .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 88"/> If you have no other objections but those I have alluded to , and which I have sufficiently obviated , I would , by all means , wish you to return immediately to England .
- But pr ` ythee why , my dear Hume , have you made a comparison so extremely injurious to our fair countrywomen ?
whose beauty , is at least the boast of Europe ; nor do I believe that either Georgia , or the Grecian isles , can produce any thing that surpasses them , in loveliness or elegance of form : your home-brewed beer was a simile for a porter , or at best for a mere hunting ` squire .
</p>
<p>
I am firmly persuaded , from this instance , that you have conversed more with Englishmen than foreigners , since you have been on the continent - This is <page type="Page 89"/> one of the unpardonable absurdities common to our nation .
- We go , or are sent abroad , by our friends - I had almost said our enemies - at great expence ; and then , instead of informing ourselves of the manners and police of the places we are in , our first pursuit is to find out our countrymen , and herd with them continually , merely because they are so ; by which conduct we contrive still to retain those prejudices we should have left at home , and cultivate only the follies and vices we meet with abroad .
</p>
<p>
But a truce with reflections of every kind : and in answer to your query , with regard to the situation of my heart , I can with truth assure you , that it is infinitely more wretched than your own .
- I never had the least reason to flatter myself <page type="Page 90"/> with the most distant idea of being beloved by the object of my passion , yet had my vanity inspired me with the fond hope of having obtained some small share in her friendship and esteem - How I have forfeited this blessing I know not ; but it now is fled , my friend , and with it all my happiness .
</p>
<p>
I have been , for some time past , at the seat of Sir Arthur Ashford ; you must remember him at college ; he has a sister , who is both handsome and agreeable ; and had I a disengaged heart , I know no woman to whom I would sooner offer my hand - But never shall I be guilty of such , baseness , as to defraud an innocent and amiable woman of her affections , while , like a wretched bankrupt , I have not an equivalent to make .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 91"/> The circumstance of Miss Ashford 's living with her brother , will prevent my spending as much of my time with him as I could wish .
- The world will be apt to suppose that her attractions might have drawn me thither , and this may possibly prevent a real and deserving lover from making his addresses there - I will , therefore , speedily retire to my own seat , to solitude and sorrow .
</p>
<p>
You are incapable of forming any idea of the charming , delicate , but distracted situation of my mind - May happier days be yours !
Adieu ,
</p>
<p>
my friend ,
</p>
<p>
LUCAN .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 92"/> Southfield .
</p>
<p>
YES , Fanny , I confess it !
you have searched my bosom , and found the arrow rankling in my heart !
Too cruel sister !
better , sure far better , that you had remained ignorant of my disease , unless you can prescribe a cure !
I now detest myself ; and all that generous confidence , which is the true result and firm support of real virtue , is for ever fled !
I shrink even from the mild eye of friendship - The tender , the affectionate looks of Harriet and Lucy , now distress me !
How then shall I endure the stern expression of contempt and rage , from an offended husband 's angry brow !
There is but one thing <page type="Page 93"/> that could be more dreadful - I mean his kindness - That alone could add new horrors to my wretched state , and make me feel the humiliating situation of a criminal still more than I now do .
</p>
<p>
I am , I am a criminal !
Alas !
you know not to what degree I am so !
But I will tell you all , lay bare my heart before you , and beg you not to soothe , but probe its wounds .
</p>
<p>
At about a quarter of a mile from our house , there is an octagon temple , which overlooks a fine piece of water , adjoining to which there is a beautiful and extensive wood ; this room then , I have fitted up in a very elegant taste , as a small library , or museum , for myself , and it is intirely devoted to my hours of <page type="Page 94"/> retirement - Here I read , write , draw , or ruminate .
In this spot , on the day after I last wrote to you , was I sitting and musing , I will confess it , on the happiness which might have been my portion , had I happened to have met Lord Lucan before I was Sir William Barton 's wife .
</p>
<p>
The tears streamed insensibly from my eyes , and so much dimmed my sight , as to make it doubtful whether the figure I then saw of Lord Lucan , walking by the canal , was real , or visionary - I rose immeditaely to the window , and perceived it to be him .
</p>
<p>
He came slowly on , gazing intently on a miniature picture , which he sometimes pressed to his lips , and sometimes held at a distance , as if to place it in different <page type="Page 95"/> points of view .
Blushing , I own it , Fanny , I felt the pangs of jealousy ; I doubted not but it was Miss Ashford 's picture , and instantly detested the origiginal - How unworthy , how unjust , do I now appear , in my own sight !
</p>
<p>
My feet became as much rivetted to the place where I stood , as Lord Lucan 's eyes were to the picture - He saw me not , till he came close to the window , and then , in the utmost confusion , slipt the portrait into his pocket .
</p>
<p>
He came into the temple , covered with blushes , made a thousand apologies for having intruded upon my retirement , though he said he had come on purpose to take his leave , as he meant to quit Sir Arthur Ashford 's , and set out for his own seat , the next day .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 96"/> With more pique than prudence , I told him that I was surprised at his having resolution sufficient to tear himself from a person , whose picture was so dear to him as I supposed that to be , to which I had seen him pay his adorations , when I fancied he might have the original as a companion for life , if he chose it .
</p>
<p>
I never saw surprise so strongly painted , as in his countenance - His voice faltered while he replied , ' `` Were that possible , madam , I should be the happiest man alive - But , alas !
there is a bar , an insuperable bar , which can not be surmounted !
therefore , madam , do I tear myself from the too lovely object of a despairing passion . '' '
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 97"/> I was very near as much confused as Lord Lucan , and , without knowing what I said , replied , ' `` I pity you , my Lord , and am truly sorry . '' '
- At that instant , he in an extacy , exclaimed , O stop !
most honoured !
most beloved of women !
nor raise my transports to that dangerous height , which may exceed to madness !
yet , yet again repeat the charming sound !
and by your pity overpay my sufferings .
</p>
<p>
It was impossible for any one , not quite an idiot , to misunderstand this declaration - Yet was I absurd enough to seem ignorant of his meaning , and answered that I did not conceive of what use my pity could be to him , as I could not hope to have more influence on Miss Ashford , than himself .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 98"/> He started from his seat , and , with a look that seemed to pierce through all my little artifice , cried out ' `` Miss Ashford , Madam !
how is it her concern ?
Surely , my Lord , I replied , I thought it was that Lady 's picture , with which you seemed so much delighted , as you walked along . '' '
</p>
<p>
He gazed on me again with earnestness , as he would read my thoughts , and then with downcast looks , as speaking to himself , he said - ' `` It must be so !
that form , that angel form , can not deceive , and my temerity is yet a secret - It shall remain so ; for I will fly , for ever , from her sight . '' '
</p>
<p>
He turned away his face , to hide his tears ; and had I suffered our conversation to have ended there , I had been far less <page type="Page 99"/> guilty than I am .
- But vanity , that bane of female virtue , led me on , to tell him that I could not be satisfied , without a farther explanation on this subject ; and that , as he had declared Miss Ashford was not the object of his passion , I hoped he could have no objection to shewing me the picture of a person , whom , in all probability , I neither did , nor possibly might ever know .
</p>
<p>
He looked at me then , with a countenance more solemn than I had ever seen him wear : I blushed excessively , from a consciousness of my own insincerity ; he saw into my thoughts , and , with a firm , and yet affecting manner , spoke thus .
</p>
<p>
' `` Do not , for your own sake , Madam , extend the cruelty of your triumph beyond <page type="Page 100"/> my demerits , nor wantonly sport with the miseries of one , whom yon have , though innocently , rendered wretched .
Nature formed you in her most perfect model , and gave me susceptibility to admire those charms , which , to my endless grief , were then devoted to another .
- I sought , not Madam , to invade his right , or soil the purity of your fair bosom , with one improper thought .
Your friendship , your esteem , I wished to gain ; and for that purpose kept my love concealed .
Chance only has revealed it - How am I to blame ?
or wherefore should I now become the object of your hatred , or contempt ?
Your pity was the sole indulgence I ever should have dared to have solicited and that you might , without a crime , have bestowed .
The wildness of my passion flattered my fond hopes that you <page type="Page 101"/> had just now granted it - Judge of its value by my transports , Madam - But you recal the precious gift ; and all that I now dare presume to ask , is your forgiveness ; allow me that , and never more shall the unhappy Lucan offend your eyes , or feast his own , with gazing on your charms . '' '
</p>
<p>
Tears stopped his utterance - O , Fanny !
was it possible that my eyes should be dry ?
they streamed too surely - I confess my weakness - At that moment my heart first felt the luxury of tears - The soft effusion flowed from pity , from tenderness , from - dare I pronounce it , love !
</p>
<p>
The emotion he discovered at seeing me weep , was quite extravagant - He <page type="Page 102"/> threw himself at my feet , snatched my hand , and pressed it to his lips , and vowed he would never rise till I pronounced his pardon .
At that instant , I heard the sound of voices that approached us , and exclaimed , ' `` Rise , my Lord , I pardon , and I pity you . '' '
</p>
<p>
He had scarce time to obey me , before Colonel Walter , Lucy , and Harriet entered the temple - The apparent confusion , both of Lord Lucan 's looks , and mine , with the tears that still trembled in our eyes , was but too visible to pass unnoticed ; Lucy appeared surprised at the sight of Lord Lucan , Harriet 's face was covered with blushes , and the Colonel , by a malignant smile , shewed that he enjoyed our distress .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 103"/> He presented me with a letrer from Sir William , whom he had left in Dublin , and said he hoped that would plead his excuse , for having interrupted what he thought the most agreeable party in the world , a sentimental tête à tête ; and turning briskly to Lord Lucan , asked him if he had been relating the melancholy story of Eloise and Abelard , or the more disastrous loves of Hero and Leander ?
</p>
<p>
Pique now got the better of my confusion , and , without waiting for Lord Lucan 's reply , I answered , that we need not go so far back , for melancholy tales ; for that I was acquainted with some persons now living , whose sufferings far exceeded those of the unfortunate ladies he had mentioned .
He turned his piercing eyes quick upon me , at these words , <page type="Page 104"/> and for the first time of his life , I believe , blushed .
</p>
<p>
O , Fanny , what an indiscreet , and consequently unhappy wretch , is your sister !
Thank Heaven , Mrs. Walter is out of his reach !
But have I not , by this unguarded speech , betrayed the secret to her tyrant !
I never shall forgive myself .
</p>
<p>
My Lucy , ever kind and attentive to her now unworthy friend , relieved us all from our embarrassment , by rendering the conversation general , and proposed our returning to the house , as there was hardly time for me to dress , before dinner ; and added , that she would either endeavour to entertain the gentlemen at the harpsichord , or engage with them at billiards .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 105"/> We then all set out , seemingly at ease - But who can read the human heart , or the various springs that actuate its movements !
Mine , wretched as it is , had then received a hateful guest , unknown to it before !
Consciousness of having erred !
its sure attendants , fear , and shame , now followed close , and when I reached my toilet , and viewed my shadow in the glass , my colour varied , as these passions worked , and I became alternate red and pale .
</p>
<p>
Poor Benson saw the effect , without the cause , and was alarmed - She would have got me drops , which I refused : sick , sick at heart I was , but where is the medicine that can abate its conflicts !
Lethe !
O for a draught of it !
- A shower of tears somewhat relieved me ; I read <page type="Page 106"/> Sir William 's letter ; cruellest of husand 's !
it was the kindest that he had ever wrote , since he obtained that title !
He will return to Southfield , in a few days - How shall I look upon him , Fanny ?
</p>
<p>
I can not now go on , my next shall tell you all .
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
P.S. I have read Mrs. Walter 's letter , and yours ; but am at present incapable of answering either .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 107"/> Southfield .
</p>
<p>
AMIDST the variety of disagreeable thoughts which had disturbed me , curiosity asserted its rights in a female breast , and increased my uneasiness , by a wish to know how Lord Lucan had obtained my picture .
- I never had but two miniatures taken of me ; one , in my happy days , for my dear Fanny ; and a second , last winter , in Dublin , at the earnest request of my niece , soon after she came to live with us .
- It was impossible that he should be in possession of the first , and a train of very unpleasant ideas succeeded to the thought of Harriet 's having given him the latter .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 108"/> I sent for her directly - When she came into my dressing-room , I perceived she had been weeping , and I also perceived my picture on her arm - This put a stop to the inquiry I had designed to make ; and by way of saying something , I asked her where Lord Lucan was ?
She said she had just then left him in Sir William 's library .
</p>
<p>
My curiosity was again raised to know the cause of Harriet 's tears ; I could not ask her - But my heart informed me - She loves Lord Lucan .
- Unhappy girl !
yet still far happier than I !
she may , without a blush , avow her passion ; while mine must cover me with endless shame .
</p>
<p>
Yet wherefore should there be this false distinction ?
If passion is involuntary , <page type="Page 109"/> it can not be criminal ; 't is consequences only that can make it so ; and Harriet and Louisa both may love , with innocence .
-
</p>
<p>
Flattering sophistry !
Alas !
I would deceive myself , but can not !
Have I not vowed , even at the altar vowed , to love another ?
Yet can that vow be binding , which promises what is not in our power , even at the time we make it ?
But grant it were , the contract sure is mutual ; and when one fails , the other should be free .
</p>
<p>
Wretched Louisa !
strive no more to varnish o'er thy faults - Thou wert a criminal , in the first act , who wedded without love ; and all the miseries which proceed from thence , too justly are thy due .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 110"/> Yes , Fanny , I will take your counsel , and will patiently submit to those corrosive chains , which I myself have riveted ; I will not murmur , but I must complain to you , and you alone , my friend , my sister !
Desert me not , while I deserve your pity , and I will still endeavour to deserve it !
</p>
<p>
Lord Lucan is gone !
My intreaties have prevailed , he returns not to Ash-park , or Southfield , any more .
- Do not congratulate me on this imaginary triumph ; I have bought the concession but too dear - I have avowed my love !
Do not detest me , Fanny !
I saw no other way to secure my virtue - By confessing my passion , I have put it out of my power ever to see , or converse with the object or it more - He is banished for ever from <page type="Page 111"/> my sight - What would my sister , or what the rigid world , have more !
</p>
<p>
With infinite difficulty I discovered that the innocent and undesigning Harriet had lent him my picture , and he sent off his servant to France , to get it copied , who returned with it to Ash-park , on the day I first saw it in his hand .
</p>
<p>
I shall never take notice of this affair , to her , as I too well know how difficult it must be to refuse the request of one we love - But surely his making this request must have severely pained her tender heart - Sweet , gentle innocent !
I most sincerely pity her distress .
</p>
<p>
The detestable Colonel Walter stays with us still , though unasked - I think <page type="Page 112"/> he looks with prying eyes , on all my actions ; yet what are they to him ?
He has no friendship , either for Sir William , for me , or any one else .
- Cruel consciousness that compelled me to banish Lord Lucan , and suffer Colonel Walter to remain in my house !
Have I not , Fanny , sufficiently sacrificed to forms and scruples ?
</p>
<p>
I have this moment received a letter from Sir William ; business detains him for a month longer in town - I rejoice , for his sake , as much as my own ; as I hope I shall recover a greater degree of composure , than I am at present mistress of , by the time he returns .
</p>
<p>
I detest dissimulation , yet as Lucilla says , ' `` Dissembling may for once be <page type="Page 113"/> virtuous , '' ' * at least so far as to conceal that fault which can not now be prevented - Yet trust me , Sir William , trust me , my honoured brother , and beloved sister , no stain shall ever rest upon your names , from my misconduct !
I only ought , and I alone will suffer - My vow is passed to heaven , and to you .
</p>
<p>
This unhappy subject has so totally engrossed my thoughts , that I find it impossible to think of any other ; excuse me , therefore , to our amiable friend , Mrs. Walter ; embrace her , and kiss the young Olivia , for me .
Tell me of all your healths , and happiness , which will supply some to your ever
</p>
<p>
affectionate sister , L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 114"/> P.S. .
The Colonel has never taken the least notice of the suspicious appearances in the temple - He has informed us , that his intended match with Mrs. Layton is quite off ; seems perfectly gay and alert , and appears inclined to pay his addresses to Miss Ashford .
- I have injured her , without design ; but should he have the least chance to succeed there , I will atone the injury I have done her , by preventing the connection .
</p>
<p>
Lucy sets off this moment - An express from her lover , who lies dangerously ill in Dublin , hurries her away - She is distracted - I envy her distraction - She may to all the world declare her grief , her love , for the deserving Creswell !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 115"/> INDEED , my Louisa , your two last letters have afflicted me beyond measure : my heart bleeds for your sufferings , yet reason and virtue both forbid my endeavouring to soothe your grief , or stop your flowing tears , unless I could remove the cause from whence they spring - That , alas !
can only be hoped for , from the lenient hand of time , and your own fortitude .
</p>
<p>
I know how very difficult it is to enter so far into another person 's situation , as is necessary to judge their actions with candor ; we must first feel and think as they do , before it can become possible <page type="Page 116"/> - I have , therefore , endeavoured by a thorough recollection of your temper and sentiments , joined to the similarity of our natures , to put myself as it were in your place , in order to be able , with justice and precision , to give my opinion freely , both with regard to your past and future conduct .
</p>
<p>
I will now venture to tell you that the source of your present unhappiness is to be traced much higher than the aera you date it from , your marriage with Sir William Barton - Though I admit your own confession , that your first fault was committed then - It must be the joining of hearts , not hands , that can insure the marriage rights - I do n't mispell the word * - And the woman who stretches out an empty hand , at the altar , <page type="Page 117"/> but mocks the institution ; and , if I may hazard the boldness of the expression , becomes guilty , before her crime ; receives an antepast of misery , ' `` And puts her trust in miracles , for safety . '' '
</p>
<p>
But the partiality of our ever dear and respected parents , sowed the first seeds of vanity , in my Louisa 's mind ; they lived not long enough to be alarmed at its growth , and to eradicate the poisonous weed - By their death , you became your own mistress , at an age when self-applause is predominant , in every female breast - Young , beautiful , rich , and accomplished , how was it possible you should escape the snares of flattery ?
They twined about your heart ; and I have great reason now to believe , and lament , that the envied preference you <page type="Page 118"/> gave to Sir William Barton , by becoming his wife , was owing more to his having persevered longer than the rest of your admirers , in his attentions and attendance on you , than to that just selection , which should be the reward of distinguished merit , and in which both love and esteem should happily unite .
</p>
<p>
At the time of your marriage , I had made but very slight observations on the matrimonial state , and therefore did not doubt , that though you declared yourself insensible of any passion for Sir William , you might be perfectly happy with him , all the days of your life - I am now convinced of the fallacy of this opinion , as well as of the imprudence of the declaration you then too openly and unguardedly made .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 119"/> Believe me , Louisa , that this was the first thing that soured your husband 's temper - Men are naturally proud and jealous ; they do not easily brook disappointments , or mortifications ; a hopeless pursuit must be attended with both - We are not then to wonder either at Sir William 's declining it , or resenting his ill success .
</p>
<p>
In a former letter you say , that ' `` had Sir William continued to solicit your affections a little longer , they would have been all his . '' '
You know not that , Louisa ; your vanity was flattered by the assiduities of a lover , and your pride revolted at the authority of a husband - Neither of these sentiments have any thing to do with passion - Had you loved the man you married , you would have wished <page type="Page 120"/> to preserve his affection , without being vain of it ; and had you seen it declining , you would have tried every means to recover it , without considering how much your pride would be hurt by its loss .
</p>
<p>
There are , I am convinced , abundance of ingredients necessary to form an happy union for life ; but love is , in my opinion , of all others the most necessary - Like the sun , it not only brightens and gilds every amiable quality of the beloved object , but draws forth every latent virtue in our hearts , and excites us to become as perfect as we can , in order to merit that affection which constitutes our true happiness .
</p>
<p>
Milton seems to be of my opinion , when he makes the first of lovers , and of men , say thus to Eve , -
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 121"/> '' I from the influence of thy looks receive '' Access in every virtue , in thy sight '' More wise , more watchful , stronger , if need were '' Of outward strength ; while shame , thou looking on , '' Shame to be overcome or over-reached , '' Would utmost vigor raise , and raised unite . ''
I know not why , or how I have launched out into this dissertation upon matrimony , unless it be that I wish to avoid the painful subject of your last letters , and yet can not turn my thoughts upon any thing quite foreign to it - I think I ought , at least , to acknowledge that I am pleased with the resolution you have shewn in banishing Lord Lucan ; and the delicacy of your motive for confessing your passion to him , is the only possible excuse that can be urged for such an hazardous impropriety .
</p>
<p>
But let me now hope that my dear Louisa 's virtue will soon enable her to <page type="Page 122"/> rise above the want of an apology , and that a proper consciousness of what she owes to herself , will assist her to triumph over that unhappy weakness , which she so pathetically describes , as the harbinger of fear and shame - Hateful , destructive passions !
O be they banished far from every generous breast !
and , in their room , may hope and joy expand my sister 's heart !
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Walter 's health continues extremely delicate ; the physicians , who attend her , give me hopes that she may recover , though slowly - If it were not for that sweet promiser Hope , I should at this moment be the most wretched of mortals , for at this moment every creature that I truly love , is unhappy - Can I then be otherwise ?
I should be sorry if I could .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 123"/> My brother has given his final negative to Mrs. Colville 's proposal : on her account he will not stay longer in Paris ; and on his own , he will not return to England - He intends to cross the Alps , in pursuit of amusement - May he find that , and every thing else he wishes !
</p>
<p>
Adieu , my beloved Louisa ,
</p>
<p>
F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 124"/> Southfield .
</p>
<p>
'' Then all the boasted office of thy friendship , '' Was but to tell Louisa , what a wretch she is : '' Alas !
What need that ? ''
I Can not help saying , Fanny , that these lines seem but too applicable to your last letter .
When I poured forth the anguish of my breaking heart before you , had I not a right to expect that my friend and sister would have spoken peace to its sorrows , and poured wine and oil on its wounds ?
You tell me that ' `` reason and virtue forbid these tender offices , in my unhappy case . '' '
Are reason and virtue , then , at war with wretchedness ?
And must guilt be always <page type="Page 125"/> connected with misery ?
Or is it , can it be true , that misfortunes loosen the ties of blood as well as friendship , and leave the wretch infected by them , to be hurried down the stream of life , at the mercy of their own wild passions , more destructive far than raging winds and seas !
</p>
<p>
Forgive me , Fanny , for this horrid thought !
I know your heart is generous and good , and that you did not mean to add to my distress - Nay , I am certain that each wound you gave , was doubly felt by you - Yet why , my sister , should you think it necessary to deal severely with me ?
If , as you seem to think , vanity is my predominant foible , why did not my fair philosopher find out its use , and play it off against my <page type="Page 126"/> present weakness ?
We should never humble that heart too much , which we have any hopes of reclaiming .
</p>
<p>
When we become completely vile in our own sight , we have but little reason to hope for the good opinion of others , which , I much fear , is one of our strongest incitements to virtue ; and when , as you have before observed , we are totally indifferent to what the world thinks of us , we too generally not only meet , but deserve , its censure and contempt .
</p>
<p>
A woman still , my Fanny , under all my distresses , I am inclined to justify the foible you hint at ; nay more , to prove that it approaches to the very province of virtue ; as it is at least capable of rousing it to action , and sometimes of assisting its operations .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 127"/> ' `` Respect thyself '' ' is certainly one of the best tenets , that has ever been conveyed to us - Yet surely it savours a little of l'amour propre ; which term , though exactly translated by the words , self love , conveys yet a different idea to my mind , and appears to have somewhat more of the lightness of vanity , than of a self-applause , in material matters .
</p>
<p>
Bravo !
Louisa !
How admirably have you trifled through this page , on a subject absolutely foreign to your heart ?
But has not my Fanny set me the example ?
And shall I not endeavour to imitate her ?
Alas !
like all other copyists , I fall short of the original , for if I write on , I shall again recur to the sad source of all my sorrows ,
</p>
<p>
'' Again indulge the woman in my soul , '' And give a loose to tears , and to complainings . ''
<page type="Page 128"/> For your sake , then , my Fanny , I will restrain my pen , and suffer this letter to reach your hands , free from the severe tax which has been too often imposed on you , by my late correspondence . '
`` For indeed I am not merry , but do beguile the thing I am , by seeming otherwise . '' '
</p>
<p>
I am running into quotations ; but they are natural to a disturbed mind ; as persons in such a state would rather use any body 's sense , than their own - For whatever can divert the mind , or turn it from its own reflections , must be a point gained from misery .
Therefore do I endeavour thus to sport , I find , in vain ; for laughter without mirth , is but hysterical , and may end in tears .
</p>
<p>
My sincerest good wishes attend Mrs. Walter , and I may venture to add , that <page type="Page 129"/> I am both to her , and you , much more than to myself ,
</p>
<p>
an affectionate friend , L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
I Might with great truth and justice reply to the lemma of my dear Louisa 's letter , by quoting the words that follow it , in the original ; * but though I may not express myself as elegantly as Mr. Rowe , I will trust my defence to the feelings of my heart , on a subject where it is so truly interested .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 130"/> If soothing could alleviate your sufferings , my pen should be taken from the cygnet 's wing , and dipped in the honey of Hybla !
But alas !
my sister , yours is a disease that will increase by indulgence , and which severity alone can cure !
</p>
<p>
There have been instances where the hand of a surgeon has trembled , from a consciousness of the misery he was obliged to inflict on his patient .
</p>
<p>
Judge then how unsteadily I now hold the pen that is to wound the heart of my Louisa , by telling her that I fear she has committed an almost irreparable error ?
</p>
<p>
I have already told you that it is long since I with grief beheld your partiality <page type="Page 131"/> for Lord Lucan ; but from the idea which you taught me to form of him , and from my thorough knowlege of the delicacy and propriety of your sentiments , joined to your situation , I had lulled myself into a perfect security , that Lord Lucan would never dare to insult the wife of Sir William Barton , with a declaration of his passion ; and that finding it intirely hopeless , he would either conquer or transfer it to some other object , from whom he might reasonably expect a proper return .
</p>
<p>
Such an attachment as Lord Lucan 's be may compared to winter plants , which , by the aid of hot-houses , are rendered capable of producing summer fruits , but must decay and die without such artificial aid .
Hope is the nurse of <page type="Page 132"/> love - without it , I am certain it can not long exist , even in the most romantic bosom .
</p>
<p>
Can I then consider my Louisa 's conduct as blameless , when I find Lord Lucan has avowed his passion ?
But what is the sentence which you would have pronounced , twelve months ago , upon a married woman who had declared that passion to be mutual ?
Guilty , guilty upon honour !
*
</p>
<p>
You have still candour enough to judge yourself as severely , as you could any one else ; you acknowlege yourself a criminal ; but whither are your candor , and your judgment both fled , when you endeavour to derive merit from what you <page type="Page 133"/> allow to be a crime , and say , that ' `` You confessed your passion , to preserve your virtue ? '' '
</p>
<p>
I begin to be extremely apprehensive that reason is a very useless property to man , and can seldom do more than direct our choice , in things that are merely indifferent to us .
Apathy is not natural to the human mind ; and yet from the moment our passions begin to operate with any degree of vigour , that same boasted reason , which philosophers tell us supplies its place , by controuling their emotions , and directing their pursuits , not only becomes instantly subservient to them , but meanly condescends to enter into the defence of their most pernicious consequences , and readily engages in the pleasing , but baneful office , of assisting us to impose upon ourselves .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 134"/> This is , and must be true - At least I wish to think so ; for I would much rather attribute my Louisa 's errors to the general defects of our nature , than account for them by supposing any particular weakness , either in her reason , or her virtue - And surely she must herself acknowlege a failure in that judgment , that can be persuaded we may set bounds to the encroachments of a lover , by telling him that he is beloved !
</p>
<p>
Alas , Louisa !
Lord Lucan is not banished from Ash-park , from Southfield , from your sight , for ever !
But both the world , and I , without being over rigid , have a right to expect that he should no more be permitted to plead his passion , or avail himself of yours .
</p>
<p>
If you should be inclined to dispute the authority which demands this sacrifice , <page type="Page 135"/> let me remind you that there is one , who has an undoubted right to claim it ; let your honour then make a willing sacrifice of all future connection with Lord Lucan , as the only atonement you can now make for the injury you have done Sir William Barton .
</p>
<p>
By this means , and this alone , you may again recover your happiness ; for I know you too well to suppose that it can ever be compatible with a consciousness of continuing to act in opposition to the strictest rectitude - I know too , that you have strength of mind sufficient to accomplish this arduous task ; and that our mental , like our bodily strength , is increased and invigorated by use .
That generous frankness , which is the genuine offspring of virtue , shall again reanimate my beloved <page type="Page 136"/> Louisa 's face , the mild eye of friendship shall no longer be painful to her , and she shall endure the piercing look of inquiry from her husband 's eyes , with soft , yet steady dignity .
- O may my wishes be prophetic !
Amen , Amen !
</p>
<p>
I will now venture to tell you that I am truly grieved for the young , the innocent , and amiable Harriet !
My concern may possibly remind you of Swift 's lines ,
</p>
<p>
'' Should some neighbour feel a pain , '' Just in the part where I complain , '' &c. I acknowledge the sympathy between us , and would do much to cure her malady .
</p>
<p>
She has , however , the advantage of me in every respect ; - she is younger , and , of course , the impression which her <page type="Page 137"/> heart has received is more likely be erased .
- The letters we carve on saplings , wear out with their growth , while those that are imprinted on the perfect tree remain indelible .
</p>
<p>
Besides , it is by no means impossible that Lord Lucan may love her yet ; for I repeat my opinion , that his passion for you is quite a sickly plant , which must necessarily perish , as I am perfectly convinced that you do n't mean to cherish it longer .
</p>
<p>
For all these good and weighty reasons , I think she may hope , or , at least , I will do so for her , that , one way or other , her heart may be set at ease .
- I am in a praying mood , and will say , amen !
to this wish also .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 138"/> I would add another petition to those I have already made , if I hoped it would succeed ; but I almost begin to despair of Mrs. Walter 's recovery - She continues to languish , without any visible sign of amendment , and the physicians now think that the air of a more southern clime , is the only chance she has for life .
</p>
<p>
She has written to the good Pere Guillaume , to recommend her to a convent that will receive her and her child , as pensioners , and allow her the liberty of going out in a carriage , for exercise , which is absolutely necessary to her existence .
</p>
<p>
Were I only to consider myself , the pain I feel at the thought of parting <page type="Page 139"/> with this charming woman would tempt me to wish that I had never known her ; but how amply am I recompensed for that , and a thousand other sufferings , by the delightful reflection of having rendered her mind perfectly tranquil , nay happy , by indulging myself in settling a small , but decent provision , on her darling child .
</p>
<p>
Can all the diamonds that ever issued from the Indian mines afford to their possessors that heart-felt glow of satisfaction I enjoyed , when I had perfected the deed which conveyed two thousand pounds into the hands of trustees , for the use of the young Olivia Walter ?
</p>
<p>
I was so apprehensive that the strong emotions of the mother 's gratitude , <page type="Page 140"/> might have affected her delicate frame , that I was almost tempted to conceal this matter from her ; yet I wished to remove every fear or doubt , which the weakness and languor of her spirits might suggest , with regard to her child 's future fate .
</p>
<p>
I wrote her a few lines , to tell her what I had done ; and added , that I would debar myself from the pleasure of seeing her , till she should give me a promise under her hand , never to mention this business to me .
</p>
<p>
She promised , indeed , what was impossible for her to perform ; and , at our next interview , I was convinced , that , as the Peruvian princess says , ' `` To be thoroughly generous , you must listen to acknowledgments . '' '
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 141"/> I have promised , that if it should please Providence to call her to a state of bliss , I will immediately take the little Olivia under my care ; and , if I live , I will most faithfully discharge the pleasing and important trust .
</p>
<p>
My spirits , not much elevated before , sink under the sad idea of Mrs. Walter 's death .
- I can not at present say more , than that I am , with unabated tenderness ,
</p>
<p>
Your truly affectionate sister , F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 142"/> SEEK no longer , my Fanny , to save me from the miseries which I have brought upon myself , but try , my sister , to secure your own peace , by devoting to oblivion , the memory of a wretch that seems marked for destruction .
- I feel the snares of fate wound round me , and I but vainly struggle to escape the toils .
</p>
<p>
A little gleam of comfort had beamed upon me , from your last letter ; - the kindness of your wishes had raised an ardor in my mind , for their accomplishment , which amounted almost to a hope of success ; and I looked forward , with anxious desire , to some future aera , when <page type="Page 143"/> my happiness should confirm your prophecy .
</p>
<p>
In this temper of mind , I walked slowly and lonely along to the temple , which I have already mentioned to you ; and if now and then a few vagrant tears strayed down my cheeks I considered them as drops of salutary woe , and did not once wish to restrain the healthful current .
- In fine , I may truly say , that many weeks have passed since my poor harrassed mind enjoyed so sweet a calm before .
- When I had reached my little asylum , I re-read your letter , and found but one passage in it that gave me pain ; I will not now say which it was , for that anguish has been entirely absorbed in a far greater one .
</p>
<p>
I took up a pen to write to you , which instantly dropped from my hand , at the <page type="Page 144"/> sight of Lord Lucan 's portrait , which lay before me on the table .
- By an involuntary motion I took up the picture , and , looking on it , exclaimed , - ' `` It is too true , Louisa !
Lord Lucan is not banished from Southfield , from Ash-park , from my sight , for ever ! ''
- ` encroaching and presuming man !
cou ` dst thou not be content with that ideal likeness , which my too fond fancy had already traced upon my mind , but at the hazard of my reputation would obtrude this mimic resemblance on my sight .
</p>
<p>
While I pronounced these words , the door opened , and Colonel Walter stood before me .
- I dropped the picture - he took it up , - seated himself by me , and addressed me in pretty near the same <page type="Page 145"/> words , which Polydore uses , when he finds Monimia in tears .
</p>
<p>
I had just presence of mind enough to say , that I was not then disposed to play the fool .
- He instantly assumed a more serious air , caught hold of my hand , and insolently declared a passion for me , which , he boasted , had commenced at the same moment with Lord Lucan 's - That respect had hitherto kept him silent , till he found that his rival was likely to carry away the prize by his audacity , and that this alone had determined him to urge his equal attachment to me .
</p>
<p>
Surprize had hitherto kept me silent , grief now stopt my utterance .
- I saw myself in the power of a wretch , whom I knew to be devoid of generosity or pity <page type="Page 146"/> - I saw my ruin plain - I see it still !
- it was in vain to deny my regard for Lord Lucan ; - the words which he had heard me utter , and the fatal picture which was then in his possession , were proofs incontrovertible .
</p>
<p>
My tears had no effect upon him - He pursued his brutal discourse , by saying that Lord Lucan was certainly more calculated for inspiring a romantic childish passion than himself , and that he most willingly resigned all the sentimental and platonic part of my affection to him , but that I had charms sufficient to render them both happy , which he hoped my prudence would incline me to , when I reflected that he was not the confident of my choice , and had therefore a right to expect that he should be bribed to secresy .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 147"/> I could contain my resentment no longer , but , with eyes sparkling with indignation , bad him fly that moment from my sight , and make whatever use his villainy might suggest , of the secret which his meanness and insolence had obtained - That I would rely for my justification from his malice , on my own innocence , and the candour of Sir William Barton , who should certainly be acquainted with the return he made to his friendship .
</p>
<p>
He replied , with the most insulting froideur , that if Sir William had really a friendship for him , he would certainly give him a preference , in the purchase of a jewel , which he neither knew how to value or preserve , and in which he seemed to have nothing more at present than <page type="Page 148"/> a nominal property .
- ' `` In short , Madam , '' ' continued he , ' `` though I have been a soldier , I am not so much inclined to cutting of throats , as to deliver you from Sir William 's tyranny , merely to leave you at liberty to bestow yourself on Lord Lucan ; but , if you will condescend to make a concession to the warmth of that passion your charms have inspired me with , I will protect you from your husband , and the whole world beside , at the hazard of my life and fortune .
- In love , at least , I am a Swiss , and will not fight without pay - Remember , Madam , that you are much more in my power than I am in yours , and that if you should attempt to raise Sir William 's resentment towards me , I can , with the greatest ease , return it upon yourself - This picture , Madam ! ''
- '
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 149"/> ' `` Restore it , Sir , this moment . '' '
- ' `` On certain terms , you may command it , Madam . '' '
- ' `` What are they ? '' '
- ' `` Make me as happy as you have made the original of it , and all my future life shall be devoted to you . '' '
- ' `` Hear me , Sir , while I call Heaven to witness , that Lord Lucan never solicited a criminal indulgence from me !
and that my heart has never yet admitted a thought that could reflect dishonour on my husband . '' '
</p>
<p>
' `` Yet criminal to him , and Heaven , I am , perhaps , for having yielded a secret , though involuntary preference , to another object .
- The punishment of this my greatest guilt , I now receive from you ; and if there be a spark of honour or humanity remaining in your <page type="Page 150"/> breast , you will not only cease to persecute an unhappy woman , who has confessed her weakness to you , but convert the unworthy passion you have dared to urge , to pity - Alas !
I dare not say , esteem ! '' '
</p>
<p>
He was silent , I ventured to look up , and through the dim medium of my tears , I thought he seemed affected .
- ' `` Charming !
angelic tyrant !
( he exclaimed ) O were that tender weakness you have now avowed , but felt for me , how should I worship even that false delicacy , which deems it criminal - But it is deceitful all - Lord Lucan , Madam , has solicited . '' '
- ' `` Never !
never , Sir ! '' '
- ' `` Recal the morning scene , at Waltersburgh . '' '
- Conviction flashed upon me , at the instant , and resentment <page type="Page 151"/> hurried me beyond all tamer considerations .
- ' `` I do , Sir ; and am now convinced you were the person who then insulted me - You only could have had the presumption to attempt so base an outrage , and your knowing it , has now revealed the mystery ; you were the audacious monster , who violated at once the laws of decency , and hospitality !
would to Heaven my death had been the consequence !
But let what will happen now , I will no longer hold a moment 's parley with you . '' '
</p>
<p>
I strove at that instant to rush out of the temple , but he prevented me , by seizing one of my hands , and saying , ' `` I plead guilty , Madam ; but be assured I never should have made so daring an essay , but that I thought , in such a <page type="Page 152"/> situation , Lord Lucan might have succeeded ; a thousand circumstances concurred to make me think so ; I looked upon the straining of his leg as a contrivance to excuse his going out with the rest of the hunters , that he might spend his time more happily with you - And had it been so , could you blame me , madam ?
My love , my admiration are as strong as his . '' '
</p>
<p>
' `` Detested love , detested admiration ! '' '
was all that I could utter .
- ' `` I know it , Madam ? '' '
- ' `` Then leave me , Sir , this moment . '' '
- ' `` Not till you have pardoned a fault , for which I never can forgive myself , as it has distressed , or offended you . '' '
- ' `` On one condition I will pardon you , Sir , and on no other . '' '
- ' `` Name it , Madam . '' '
- <page type="Page 153"/> ' `` That you shall never presume to hint your hateful passion more . '' '
- ' `` Impossible !
as well not bid me breathe !
But let not your sentence be too severe , for I have terms to make , as well as you - Suppose that I - '' '
</p>
<p>
At that instant I heard the footsteps of a person running towards the temple ; it was Harriet , who came to tell me that her uncle was arrived - ' `` Gracious Heaven !
( I exclaimed , in a low voice ) What will become of me ? '' '
The Colonel replied , in the same tone , ' `` Rely upon my friendship , and be happy . '' '
- Harriet looked amazed ; but with the utmost tenderness begged that I would compose myself , as she was sure Sir William would be shocked , were he to see my agitation .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 154"/> ' `` Not if he knew the cause , '' ' said Colonel Walter .
I stared upon him wildly ; he proceeded , ' `` Lady Barton has had a fall , and sprained her ancle , the shock has hurried her spirits , and I was this moment going to the house , to order the cabriole to bring her home . '' '
</p>
<p>
Harriet looked as if she doubted , but took the hint , and said , ' `` you had best do so , Sir , and let my uncle know of the accident , as it will account for my aunt 's delay . '' '
- I was silent ; yet sure my situation was truly pitiable , in being reduced to the sad dilemma , either of joining in a deceit with a person whom I detested , or of exposing myself to the prying eyes of my husband , under such circumstances as must alarm him , and call for explanation .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 155"/> The Colonel then turned to me , and said , ' `` Is it your pleasure , Madam , that I should go ? '' '
- ' `` Yes !
yes ! '' '
was all that I could utter , and the moment he was gone , burst again into a passion of tears ; upon which Harriet cried out , ' `` Why is not Lucy here ?
I have no influence upon my aunt , I am not worthy to advise . '' '
</p>
<p>
' `` You are , you are , my dear , what would you have me do ? '' '
- ' `` Have pity on Sir William , and yourself , and try to calm your spirits ; for sure he never will believe they could be ruffled thus , by so slight an accident .
- Believe me , Madam , I would lay down my life , to make you happy , though that is but a small compliment , for it is of very little value to myself . '' '
<page type="Page 156"/> She turned aside , to hide a starting tear - I clasped her to my breast , and said , ' `` Do not , my Harriet , add to my distress , by suffering me to think you are unhappy . '' '
</p>
<p>
Sir William and the cabriole came together ; he embraced me very affectionately , and rallied me on my cowardice in being so affected by my fall ; wanted much to see my ancle , which I declined , took me up in his arms , and seated me in the chair , walked by my side , till we got to the house , and again lifted me out of it into my dressing-room .
</p>
<p>
O think , my sister !
what I then endured !
But you can never know it ; deceit has ever been a stranger to your heart , and <page type="Page 157"/> the sharp stings of self contempt have never entered there .
</p>
<p>
Benson flew to me with arquebusade , vinegar , &c..
The consciousness of the mean part I then acted , rendered me peevish , and I hastily bid her leave the room .
- I blushed as the words escaped me - was it her fault that I was become contemptible !
- When she was gone out , Harriet said , ' `` I fear , Madam , you are much hurt , indeed ! '' '
- ' `` Yes , Harriet , to the heart ! '' '
I sunk down upon the couch , and covered my face with my handkerchief .
- She threw herself at my feet , and , without attempting to pry into the cause , implored me to let her put a bandage round my ancle , lest Sir William should be alarmed at my supposed obstinacy , and send for a surgeon .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 158"/> This I refused , and , on the instant , resolved to extricate myself from the hateful appearance of having entered into a mean collusion with Colonel Walter .
I rang the bell for Benson , and , assuming as chearful a countenance as I could put on , told her that I had not received any hurt that required particular application , and that time should be my only physician .
</p>
<p>
I then dressed myself as usual , and , when the last dinner bell rung , I desired Harriet to accompany me to the parlour .
- Sir William seemed surprized at seeing me walk , and said he was just then coming to assist me , or , as the old ballad said , to take up his load of vanity .
</p>
<p>
When I sat down to table , I found myself extremely ill ; - I tried to eat , but in <page type="Page 159"/> vain .
- I soon retired after dinner , and sat down to write this account of my mortification to you .
- It is now eight o ' clock , and I can no longer support the violent pain in my head , or hold the pen .
-
</p>
<p>
Adieu , adieu , my sister , My friend , my confident ,
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
P.S. By whom , or how contrived , the picture had been laid on the table in the temple , I can not guess ; nor know I yet through what medium to inquire about it .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 160"/> MANY days have elapsed since I concluded my last letter to my Fanny , some of them have passed like the arrow that flieth through the air , and leaves no trace behind - Would I had accompanied their flight !
but , alas !
it will not be !
and by the same Almighty fiat which first called me into being , I am again recalled from the confines of eternity - May that gracious Power that has been pleased to prolong my existence , endue me with resignation to his all-wise decrees !
</p>
<p>
I am at present but ill able to write ; the account I can give you of myself , <page type="Page 161"/> must therefore be short , but it will tell my sister that I live , and , notwithstanding my desiring her to forget me , I still flatter myself that my life is of consequence to her happiness .
</p>
<p>
The moment I had sealed my last letter to you , I found myself unable to sit up , and went to bed , but not to rest .
About eleven Sir William came into my chamber , and on finding me extremely feverish , muttered something about fine ladies being always vapourish , or indisposed , and wished me a good night .
</p>
<p>
Never was health more sincerely welcomed by a dying wretch , than sickness was now by me - I hoped , I trusted , I should be released !
and invoked the king of terrors , with the unhappy Constance ,
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 162"/> '' Oh amiable , lovely death ! ''
Arise forth from thy couch of lasting night , '' Thou hate and terror to prosperity ; '' Come , grin on me , and I will think thou smilest , '' And kiss thee as thy wife : misery 's love , '' Oh come to me ! ''
In this manner did I pass the night , rejoicing in the increase of my disorder , till the delirium which it brought on rendered me insensible to it , and every thing else : for five days I continued in a state of mental annihilation , the return of my reason , was like the appearance of an ignis fatuus , it glimmered , and vanished , several times , as if unwilling to return to the wretched habitation which it had forsaken .
</p>
<p>
Harriet , my beloved , my gentle Harriet , whose tenderness and attention to me has been unremitted , assures me <page type="Page 163"/> that Sir William was much afflicted during my illness ; and that though Colonel Walter endeavoured to console him , yet he also appeared much affected , and quitted the house the next day .
</p>
<p>
May the miseries which he has brought upon me , make a proper impression on his heart , and turn his detested passion into contrition for his crimes , and compassion for the sufferings of his injured wife !
As soon as I was pronounced out of danger , Sir William went to visit a distant part of his estate , where he is establishing a manufacture .
- He has been gone ten days , and in that time , I think both my mind and body have acquired strength ; perhaps it is owing to the weakness of the latter , that the former is more composed .
But I will <page type="Page 164"/> endeavour to enjoy the temporary calm , though I fear that the storm has only subsided , and may perhaps return with double fury , to wreck this feeble bark - Be that as it may , I shall ever remain
</p>
<p>
Your truly affectionate sister , L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
P.S. Where and how is Mrs. Walter ?
assure her of my kindest remembrance : her sufferings are so deeply engraved on my heart , that not even my own can efface them - Happy Fanny !
that have been able to mitigate even a part of her sorrows , by removing the bitter pangs of maternal anxiety for the fate of a beloved child !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 165"/> Paris .
</p>
<p>
THE seeing my letter dated from this place , will in some measure account to my dear Louisa , for my silence , at a time when she stood most in need of every consolation that friendship could bestow on a tenderly beloved and suffering sister - I am however selfish enough to rejoice that I was unacquainted with the danger that threatened your life , till it was past , for I had the painful pleasure of receiving both your letters , on my arrival here , last night .
</p>
<p>
Truly distressing and affecting as they are , my head is at present so filled with <page type="Page 166"/> the extraordinary events which have happened within a very short space , that though my heart is truly sensible of your afflictions , I find it impossible to give its feelings vent , till I have informed you of a circumstance which I am certain will afford you the sincerest pleasure .
</p>
<p>
Delia !
my brother 's beloved Delia !
Delia Colville lives !
as Zanga says , ' `` First recover that , and then you shall hear further . '' '
- Our good angel !
our dear Mrs. Walter !
received a letter from Pere Guillaume , about the middle of last month , acquainting her that he would meet her at Calais , and attend her to what part of France she pleased ; but were he to recommend any particular convent , it should be Les Dames Ursulines , at St. Omers , as the superior <page type="Page 167"/> was his near relation , and particular friend .
</p>
<p>
This reeommendation was perfectly agreeable to Mrs. Walter , for many reasons ; the vicinity of St. Omers to England , was perhaps the strongest , as it flattered her with the hopes of seeing me , at some time or other , if she lived ; and rendered the immediate removal of her daughter convenient , in case of her death .
</p>
<p>
I accompanied her to Dover , and feared that I had taken my last farewell of my amiable friend , when I saw her embark for Calais - I heard from her , in a few days after our parting , and she was not worse - I had then determined to spend the remainder of the summer <page type="Page 168"/> at Cleveland-hall , in executing some little romantic plans of improvement , in order to amuse myself , and surprise Sir George at his return from Italy , which he had promised should be before winter .
But a second letter from Mrs. Walter afforded me an opportunity of surprising him , indeed !
She told me that in the convent where she then resided , there was a very beautiful young English lady , who went by the name of Wilson , who , upon having seen the address of her letter to me , as it went to the tour , in order to be sent to the post office , implored her permission to speak to her in private ; that some time had elasped before she could find an opportunity , and when she did , she informed her that her name was Colville , Delia Colville !
I again repeat it !
That she had been placed there , <page type="Page 169"/> by her mother , without her knowledge , or consent , who had desired that she might be closely confined , debarred the use of pen and ink , and prevented from even going into the parlour , or conversing with any of the pensioners ; as she was represented to be so artful , that she would corrupt and impose on them by the insincere plausibility of her manners , and was actually upon the point of disgracing her family , by a shameful connection with a man of inferior rank and fortune .
- That in consequence of this cruel aspersion , she had been treated with the utmost severity that the rules of the convent would admit of , and that from the time of her entrance , till that moment , she had never heard from her mother , or any other person whatsoever .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 170"/> She then , blushing , mentioned Sir George Cleveland , and said she had long vainly flattered herself , that he would have sought her out , and released her from so inquitous and cruel a confinement ; but that if even he had forgotten and forsaken her , she was convinced that his sister 's humanity would interest itself in behalf of an oppressed and injured person , whom she had once honoured with the name of friend !
</p>
<p>
She added , that the mildness of her temper , and the perfect acquiescence she had shewn under the severe restraints that were imposed on her , had influenced the nuns to treat her with less harshness than at first , and that she had been lately allowed the honour of conversing with the superior ; but that the moment she attempted <page type="Page 171"/> to justify herself from her mother 's slander , she was enjoined silence , and obliged to retire to her cell ; after having this reflection urged against her , that it must be always more natural to suppose children to be undutiful or ungrateful , than that parents should be unkind or unjust .
This maxim is certainly true , in general ; but there are sometimes instances which occur in life , that baffle all philosophy , with regard to the human mind .
</p>
<p>
O , my Louisa , does not your heart grieve for the sufferings of the innocent and unoffending Delia ?
When Mrs. Walter promised her to acquaint me with her situation , she cried out , ' `` It is enough !
I know Miss Cleveland ; I shall be released !
Yet sure Sir George will at least accompany his sister , if <page type="Page 172"/> she should come to take me out of my confinement , and I shall see him once again . '' '
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Walter told her , she believed that would be impossible , for - She interrupted her , by exclaiming , ' `` Is he married ?
If he is , I may as well stay here ; Miss Cleveland 's kindness will be useless to me . '' '
- On Mrs. Walter 's telling her that he was in Italy , and not married , she kissed her hand , and bathed it with her tears , and said , ' `` Do not despise me , madam , for loving the most amiable of men - He is the counterpart of your Miss Cleveland ; and if you knew him , you would love him also ! '' '
</p>
<p>
The moment I received Mrs. Walter 's letter , I went immediately to councellor <page type="Page 173"/> W - , to know what were the proper and legal steps to be taken for the recovery of my beloved Delia : he told me he would wait on the lord chancellor , next day , and furnish me with proper powers to compel Mrs. Colville to produce her daughter in the chancery-chamber , who , as a minor , was to be considered as a ward of the court , though the guardianship of her person and fortune had been before granted to her detestable mother .
</p>
<p>
I then returned home , wrote to Mrs. Walter , and enclosed a few lines to Delia , entreating her to keep up her spirits , till I could effect her release , which I promised to do with the utmost expedition .
- I ordered my cloaths to be packed up , and a chaise with four horses to <page type="Page 274"/> be in readiness , the next day ; and the moment Counsellor W - furnished me with my instructions , I set out for Dover , accompanied by my maid and two men servants .
- There was a messenger dispatched at the same time , with his lordship 's order , to Mrs. Colville ; but if she should not be found , or should abscond upon receiving it , I am to apply to Lord H - , our ambassador in France , whom I have the honour of being very well acquainted with , to procure a special mandate from the court of Versailles , for her release .
</p>
<p>
I wrote to my brother , who is now at Naples , in a very ambiguous stile , hinting as if I had heard some vague report of Delia 's being alive ; for I durst not trust him with the mighty joy at once , <page type="Page 175"/> as I have been told that the sudden effects of that passion have sometimes been as fatal in their consequences , as those of grief .
</p>
<p>
I then informed him of my intention of going to Paris ; and said , as I knew all places were indifferent to him , I hoped he would have galantry enough to meet me there , as the pleasure I promised myself in seeing him , was the principal cause of my undertaking the journey .
</p>
<p>
The moment of my arrival at St. Omers , I was met by Mrs. Walter : I need not describe to you the effects of our interview .
- I flatter myself that she looks better than she did : she says the joy she feels at having been , though accidentally , <page type="Page 176"/> the instrument of good to the amiable Delia , has roused her spirits from the torpid state they had continued in , while she considered herself but as an useless burthen , or , at best , an insignificant blank , in life .
</p>
<p>
She told me she had not had an opportunity of seeing Miss Colville since she received my letter , but at prayers ; that she had endeavoured to render her looks as expressive as possible , by the chearfulness of her air ; and that Delia seemed to understand the hint in her favour .
She advised me not to go to the convent , as it was certain that I should not be permitted to see Miss Colville ; and her hearing that I had been there , might throw her off her guard , so far , as to alarm the nuns , and make them confine <page type="Page 177"/> her still more closely , or perhaps , tranfer her , as is sometimes the case , over to some other convent .
</p>
<p>
I was convinced by her reasons , and , restraining my fond impatience , I set out the next morning for Paris , where I arrived last night , and have the mortification to learn , this morning , that Mrs. Colville is gone to Toulouse , as it is thought , to settle there .
- The lord chancellor 's messenger is gone off post to her ; and here must I remain till his return .
</p>
<p>
And now let me assure my Louisa , that not even the joy I feel at the certainty of Delia 's restoration , can prevent me for a moment from sympathizing , in the tenderest manner , with her distress ; <page type="Page 178"/> the circumstances of which are certainly equally difficult and mortifying .
</p>
<p>
There never was any thing so unfortunately critical as your situation with that vile Walter , when Sir William 's arrival was announced : the snare , as you say , seemed contrived by fate - I honour your struggling through it , and not leting the wretch triumph in the success of his scheme , which he certainly would have done , had you carried on the deceit beyond the moment that it was absolutely necessary - I am grieved , but not surprised , at the effect which the anguish of your mind has had upon your constitution ; and am , I hope , truly thankful for your recovery - And may it be a perfect one !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 179"/> Surely , Louisa , you ought to think Lord Lucan to blame , with regard to the picture ; he must have hazarded your reputation , by making a confidante of the person who placed it on your table .
Can it be possible that the enamoured Harriet can have verified , nay exceeded , the romantic ideas of submissive tenderness , which Prior has given us in the character of his Emma .
</p>
<p>
I know not what to think ; but if Harriet be indeed the confidante of Lord Lucan , she claims the highest degree of admiration , that the strongest fortitude , joined with the tenderest sensibility , can possibly excite - But this character comprehends , perhaps , something more than woman .
Do not be outdone by her , my sister , but strive to emulate the virtue which you must admire .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 180"/> Were you to look minutely into the situation of my heart , you would find that I can practise , as well as preach ; for though I perhaps may never be intirely able to eradicate all traces of my weakness for Lord Hume , I have , by a kind of discipline , more severe than any in the Romish church , conquered my desire of speaking of him ; nor do I allow even my thoughts the fond , though sad indulgence of contemplating either his faults or merits ; for the moment his idea obtrudes itself upon my mind , I snatch up a book , or pen , and drive him directly from that place which he was not worthy to inhabit .
</p>
<p>
Take notice , that the poets are banished out of my library ; and that my present studies are of the reasoning kind , <page type="Page 181"/> and call for all my attention - I wish you could be prevailed upon to try this recipe - For indeed I am , for many reasons , more anxious for your recovery even than for my own !
My malady can only injure an individual , and that myself : yours , like a contagion , must be fatal to many - Stop the infection then , before it spreads , and you will hereafter reflect , with pleasure , that so many persons , who are , and ought to be , dear to you , are indebted for their happiness , to your virtue .
- I am convinced that this sentiment will have more weight with you , than any selfish consideration could ; for full well I know the nobleness of my Louisa 's nature .
</p>
<p>
I was much pleased with Sir William 's behaviour , on account of your supposed <page type="Page 182"/> lameness ; and still more so , with your candour , in relating it to me ; as there is no doubt but that his kindness must have luckily increased your own self-condemnation .
</p>
<p>
I wish Harriet would make you the confidante of her innocent passion for Lord Lucan ; as your tenderness for her , joined to your own delicacy , would then restrain you from the too dangerous indulgence of talking of him , at least before her ; and I should then wish that she might not be a moment out of your sight .
</p>
<p>
Forgive me , my ever dear and amiable sister !
for presuming to dictate to a heart and understanding like yours ; but the greatest physician will not prescribe <page type="Page 183"/> for himself when sick , and will even condescend to take the advice of a person whose skill he knows to be inferior to his own - All I can plead in favour of my present prescription is , that I have tried it myself with success , and that it is recommended to you by the warmest affection of
</p>
<p>
F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
Naples .
</p>
<p>
I Verily believe , my dear Lucan , that there never was a more unfortunate kinght-errant than myself , and that the renowned hero of La Mancha was but a prototype , both of my folly and my <page type="Page 184"/> sufferings .
I think , I want nothing but a ` squire as tristful as yourself , to record my misadventures in the stile of a ballad , called the Disastrous Traveller , or Lord Hume 's Garland - which would certainly supersede the Babes in the Wood , and Barbara Allen , in the English Chronicle ; and set all the nursery-maids and children in our nation a-blubbering .
</p>
<p>
My last informed you how completely I was duped at Venice ; that I had lost my mistress , and my money : ' `` Bagatelles !
not worth thinking of , say you ; cheaply off , for some thousands , '' ' &c. &c. - Well !
philosophy is a fine thing , said I to myself !
and I will endeavour to think like Lord Lucan - But I had better have recollected the famous sentence recorded to have been uttered <page type="Page 185"/> from the pulpit , by an Irish bishop ( who by the way was an Englishman , ) and prepared myself for what was to follow - ' `` Single misfortunes , ( said his reverence ) never come alone , and the greatest of evils is attended by greater . '' '
</p>
<p>
Now to apply my text .
- In a very ill temper , and with about a hundred pieces in my pocket , I set out from Venice ; and journeying by land and by water , arrived safe in the Ecclesiastical territories .
About two leagues from Tivoli my carriage broke down ; I had no attendants but one servant , who sat in the carriage with me , and very ill supplied the place of my former fellow-traveller ; I had left one footman sick at Venice , who was to follow me , and discharged all the rest of my useless parade .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 186"/> I did not chuse to leave my baggage to the care , or rather mercy , of the postilion , and as it was not quite dark , I ordered Saunders , you know old Robert , to stay by the chaise , till I could send people from Tivoli , either to mend it , or assist him to bring my trunks to some place of safety .
</p>
<p>
I had not walked half a league , when I was attacked by banditti , who demanded my purse , and on my attempting to make some resistance , as I wore a couteau de chasse , they knocked me down , gave me several cuts over the head , stript me of my money , cloaths , and watch , and left me for dead on the spot .
</p>
<p>
As it grew late , Saunders became alarmed for my safety , and tried to prevail <page type="Page 187"/> on the postilion to let him have one of the horses , in order to overtake and guard me on the road to the town .
The fellow either was , or pretended to be , afraid to stay by himself , they therefore mounted the pair , and set out together for Tivoli .
</p>
<p>
As I was left directly in the highway , the horses started as they came up to me , and when the men alighted to see what was the matter , they found me weltering in my blood , but with so much appearance of life that I still breathed , and sometimes groaned .
- Poor old Saunders tore off his shirt to bind up my wounds , as well as he could in the dark , and covered me with his own cloaths , while the postilion rode off in search of a surgeon and a litter , to convey me to some shelter .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 188"/> My senses did not return till the next day , when I found myself covered with bandages , and so faint and weak with loss of blood that I could not speak .
Saunders gave a scream of joy , at seeing me open my eyes , and recounted what had befallen me .
</p>
<p>
I lay in this state of misery above three weeks , and when I was able to rise , I had not a single garment of any sort to put on ; for the postilion , I presume , considering that I should have no further occasion for them , had assumed to himself the office of an executor , and carried off my baggage , with the chaise and horses , and got clear out of his Holiness 's dominions before there was any inquiry made after him .
</p>
<p>
I sent Saunders off immediately to Rome , with a draught on my banker , <page type="Page 189"/> which he received , and returned as quick as possible ; but I was still unable to travel , and a wound which I had received in my right arm , prevented my being able to use a pen , without suffering extremely - Let this account for your not hearing from me during my confinement .
</p>
<p>
As I had a good deal of leisure to reflect upon my own folly , I determined to grow wise incontinently ; and thought the best proof I could give of my discretion , was to turn my steps towards England - I was however obliged to go to Rome , for a few days , to settle with my banker - As soon as my business was dispatched , I set out , in pursuance of my plan , and have arrived thus far , on my route over .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 190"/> I went , as was natural , to the house where I had formerly lived with Margarita ; and could not help making some inquiries after her : to my great surprise , they told me that she was then in this city , and lived in a most exemplary manner , with an ecclesiastic , who was believed to be her brother .
</p>
<p>
A spirit of revenge took possession of me the moment that I heard of this pretended priest and brother , and I determined to see my fallen angel , upbraid her with her perfidy , and punish the villain who had robbed me of my mistress , and cheated me of my money .
</p>
<p>
I wandered about Naples , for several days , without being able to discover any trace of her : at last I bethought myself <page type="Page 191"/> of visiting the churches , for as she now pretended to be a devotee , I might possibly meet her in one of them - Accordingly I one day saw a woman kneeling at a confessional , who , though she was veiled , I immediately knew to be Margarita .
</p>
<p>
I waited for a long time before she had concluded her devotions , and joined her just as she was going out of the porch ; when I spoke to her , she lifted up her veil , and looked at me with a countenance so full of sweetness , that I instantly forgot my resentment , and could have fallen at her feet , and entreated her to be reconciled to me .
</p>
<p>
She spoke to me in a low voice , and said , ' `` I have used you ill , my lord , but I have been severely punished for my <page type="Page 192"/> crime ; I dare not hope you should again receive me into your favour , but come and accept of all the restitution that is now in my power to make you ; I live in the Strada del Santo Marco ; my tyrant will be asleep by eleven o'clock , I shall then at least have an opportunity of imploring your forgiveness - I dare not talk to you longer , adieu . '' '
</p>
<p>
Despise me as you will , Lucan , I confess that I felt my tenderness for this infamous woman revive , and instead of going directly to a magistrate , or endeavouring to do myself justice on her , and her vile accomplice , I counted the minutes with impatient expectation of that happy one , which should again restore me to the pleasure of seeing and conversing with her .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 193"/> At the time appointed I repaired to my rendezvous , which was at a considerable distance from the place where I lived , and in a very retired part of the town : as I passed through an unfrequented street , I was set upon by four bravos ; I instantly drew my sword , and determined to sell my life as dear as possible - As I had the advantage of a wall at my back , I defended myself successfully , for a few minutes ; but should have been overpowered if providence had not sent Sir George Cleveland , and another gentleman , to my rescue .
At their approach the bravoes would have fled , but I secured one of them whom I had wounded , and who proved to be the pretended priest and brother of Margarita .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 194"/> When we had lodged him properly , and I had got a slight wound , which I had received , dressed , I communicated the whole of my adventure frankly to Sir George , and wished him to accompany me in pursuit of that worthless woman , whom I supposed to be an accomplice in the intended assassination , and whom I now resolved to give up to justice .
</p>
<p>
Sir George is a gallant fellow , Lucan .
He talked so very rationally , that he dissuaded me from my purpose , as he said the bringing Margarita to punishment , if I should have resolution sufficient to do so , must of necessity expose myself ; observing also , that I ought not to pursue a wretch with too much rigour , whom I had formerly contributed to render abandoned .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 195"/> His remarks upon the folly and baseness of men , in their commerce with the unhappy of the other sex , were truly generous - I remember but one of them at present .
I think he said , ' `` That we first take pains to destroy the foundation of every female virtue , modesty ; and are then surprised to find the superstructure totter . '' '
- That is foolish enough to be sure , though we practise it every day .
</p>
<p>
But to conclude , for I begin to think you are heartily tired , as even I grow a little weary , though I am talking of myself , which is the pleasantest of all subjects .
- The next morning brought me a most doleful letter , from my Fair Penitent , entreating me , for the love I once bore her , not to prosecute her brother , <page type="Page 196"/> as she still affected to stile him , declaring herself intirely innocent of any evil intentions of his , with regard to my life , and offering to refund whatever remained of the jewels she had robbed me of , provided I would but remit the prosecution .
</p>
<p>
I consulted with Cleveland , who advised me not to be prevailed on to suffer such a pest to society , as Pere Jacques , to escape ; but if he would give up his accomplices , to use my interest to get them all sent to the gallies together ; as to la bella Signora , he thought I should make terms with her also , and let her compound for her crimes by a life of repentance - That the jewels she mentioned , should be sold , in order to pay her pension among les Filles repenties , where she should be obliged to enter on her probation immediately .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 197"/> I was charmed with this scheme , and by his assistance have happily put it in execution .
- Would he could be as successful in restoring me to the esteem of an amiable woman , as he has been in extricating me from the artifices of a vile one - But I have never yet dared to name Miss Cleveland to him ; and I will patiently go through a year of probation under his eye , before I even presume to hope that he will favour my suit .
- In the mean time I am happy to find , from his behaviour , that he is a stranger to mine , upon that occasion .
</p>
<p>
He talks of returning to England in a few months .
- I am determined to accompany him , and I hope that you will have got so far the better of your romantic passion , by that time , as to quit <page type="Page 198"/> your sorrowful solitude , and meet us there .
</p>
<p>
Here ends my woeful story , which however , has had a fortunate conclusion .
May all your adventures terminate as happily , sincerely wishes your
</p>
<p>
affectionate friend HUME .
</p>
<p>
P.S. I have this moment received a billet from Sir George Cleveland , acquainting me that he means to set out immediately for Paris - This is a sudden flight , but I am determined to accompany him .
Direct to me accordingly .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 199"/> My dear Hume ,
</p>
<p>
I Sincerely congratulate you on the operatical denouèment of your Italian comedie ; and think that even Metastasio has not wound up any of his catastrophes with more poetical justice , than you have shewn in the disposal of your dramatis personae .
</p>
<p>
But the most enviable part of your good fortune , is the having met with such a friend as Sir George Cleveland , whose knowlege of the world , joined to an excellent understanding , and an amiable heart , ( all which he has shewn in the management of your affair with Margarita ) must render him at once an object of your <page type="Page 200"/> affection and respect ; and afford you an opportunity of benefiting , both by his precepts and example .
</p>
<p>
I have not the honour of knowing Sir George , but have heard his character , description , and story .
He is neither older , wiser , nor better principled than you are ; to what then are we to impute the difference between the preceptor and the pupil ?
To nothing more than a circumstance which I am glad to lay hold of , for your instruction .
He had conceived a strong , but chaste passion , for a woman of merit , whose name I know not ; than which , nothing in nature more elevates the mind , improves the understanding , refines the manners , and purges the affections of man .
His mistress is dead , I hear lately , but the influence <page type="Page 201"/> of virtue reaches beyond the grave ; for a heart once rendered pure , like a transmuted metal , can never degenerate into its original baseness again .
</p>
<p>
I have often thought that many of the errors of our young men of quality , are owing to a wrong choice of the governors to whom they are intrusted , at the most critical aera of their lives , when their passions are strongest , and their judgment weakest - I mean when they are thought old enough to be sent abroad for improvement , and not deemed wise enough to conduct themselves .
</p>
<p>
Fathers and guardians , on this occasion , generally fix on some person of learning , which by the ignorant is frequently mistaken for sense ; as what is <page type="Page 202"/> called a liberal education , is as falsly , and frequently , supposed to be as synonimous with a liberal mind .
</p>
<p>
The greatest blockheads I have ever known , have been bred in college - Neither absurdity nor meanness prevent a man from becoming master of a language , nor of arriving at a competent knowlege in any particular branch of science .
</p>
<p>
But these are not the qualifications necessary to form a noble mind ; and yet an ignorant pedant , is not only the first person from whom we receive the rudiments of education , but is too often the last , to whose final care we are consigned , to receive that fine polish , to which our mind and manners owe their most distinguished <page type="Page 203"/> lustre - that moral enamel , which both brightens and preserves .
</p>
<p>
If I should ever be happy enough to see a son of mine at a fit age to send abroad , I shall endeavour to find out a governor for him , qui a vecú ; I mean one who , with a complete experience of the world , has both sense and virtue sufficient to detest vice , admire virtue , and yield indulgence to the foibles and irregularities of youth and inexperience ; whose morality should exceed
</p>
<p>
'' The fixed and settled rules , '' Of vice , and virtue , in the schools ; '' and whose principles of religion , though perfectly conformable to our established mode of worship , should , with regard to the best characteristic of it , know no difference of sect , but extend itself to the <page type="Page 204"/> outermost line of the great circle of charity , which embraces all mankind .
You will , perhaps , say that I have drawn an ideal character , like that of a patriot king .
- It may be so ; but the person I should select for such a purpose , of entering a young man of rank or fortune into the world at large , should be some reduced officer , whose humanity had been rather softened , than hardened , by danger and disappointment ; one who had been trained up in the school of honour , which may be styled the true sublime of morals - And such a guardian , preceptor , or passport through life , I should prefer to the whole conclave of parsons ; out of which class of men are too generally chosen the bear-leaders to our modern cubs of quality .
- So much for governors .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 205"/> I think you judge rightly , in not mentioning Miss Cleveland to Sir George , while your amour with Margarita is so recent - There is something extremely indelicate in professing a passion for a virtuous woman , before we have undergone a sufficient quarantine , after the contagion of an abandoned one - A man in such a situation resembles a centaur , half human , half brute - Or at best he can but say with Cyrus 's friend Araspes , ' `` I have two souls ! '' '
Sir George is too good a judge of human nature , not to excuse your infatuation in favour of an artful beauty ; but how shall Miss Cleveland be reconciled to your infidelity ?
or on what security shall she rest her hope , that you may not be subject to a second delirium ?
Indeed , my dear Hume , a year is too short for a term of probation , <page type="Page 206"/> or rather of atonement , though you were to spend it in the severe penance which your prototype Don Quixote endured , for the disenchantment of Dulcinea , upon the Black Mountain .
</p>
<p>
By the way , I think the constancy and sufferings of that renowned knight bear a much greater similitude to my sufferings than to yours ; for I do not find that you resemble him in any point but your misadventures , which like his , were the natural and necessary consequences of madness , enthusiasm , and folly - I hope I may venture to say this without offence , as you have so seriously declared your determination of becoming wise incontinently .
</p>
<p>
If any thing could have tempted me to leave Ireland , at present , it would <page type="Page 207"/> have been to meet you in London ; but as you have now a much stronger inducement than my company , to urge your return , I shall remain in what you call my sorrowful solitude , as it is now not only become pleasant , but dear to me ; for solitude is sometimes the nurse of contentment , as well as of woe .
</p>
<p>
From this hint , you will conclude my heart to be more at ease , than when I wrote last to you , and your conclusion will be just .
- It is , indeed , much more at ease , yet more anxious still - Love deals in contradictions you see .
</p>
<p>
I shall now conclude , with subscribing myself , my dear Hume 's
</p>
<p>
affectionate friend , and servant , LUCAN .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 208"/> Paris .
</p>
<p>
I Tell you , Lucan , there is no such thing as resisting fate - Here am I , with as good and sober dispositions as any man of two and twenty in Europe , for ever getting into some scrape or other , without temptation , or excuse ; or even knowing how , or why , I became engaged !
Well , then , a knight errant I certainly am , of nature 's own dubbing , and I will now courteously relate to you , myself , for want of a ` squire , my new achievement .
</p>
<p>
But first I must acquaint you , that ever since our arrival here , Sir George <page type="Page 209"/> Cleveland has been so totally taken up with some private business of his own , that poor melancholy I have been left to the pleasant amusement of contemplating my own extravagance , and folly , which has , you know , deprived me of the happiness of seeing , or conversing with his charming sister , who has met him here ; and as I quitted Naples almost at a minute 's warning , I left old Robert to pack up my cloaths , and bring them after me .
</p>
<p>
In this situation I could not possibly make my appearance in public , or even venture to visit any of my quondam acquaintance , in my travelling-dress .
- I spent two days , tout seul , and found an unlucky truth , that any company would be less dull to me than my own .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 210"/> On this discovery I sallied forth , and in sauntering along the Boulevard , I happened to meet Jack Wilson , of the guards , who is as dissipated a genius as myself .
I proposed to him our going to dine at some of the environs of Paris , to which he readily agreed - A chaise was ordered directly , we drove of to Noisy le Sec .
</p>
<p>
We walked about while dinner was preparing , and at a little distance observed a castle , defended by a deep moat , great iron gates , a draw-bridge , and immense high walls .
- The appearance of this extraordinary mansion , roused my chivalry ; I figured to myself a beauteous damsel confined there by some horrid enchanter , or giant , and determined that I would , if possible , set the fair captive <page type="Page 211"/> free .
Wilson laughed at my romantic ideas , but they had taken too strong possession of me to be easily baffled .
</p>
<p>
When we returned to our inn , we inquired from our host , who were the inhabitants of that Gothic fortress .
- He told us they were two very beautiful young ladies , of high birth and large fortunes , who being determined never to marry , yet disliking the severities of a convent , had chose to seclude themselves from the world in that retirement .
</p>
<p>
He added , that the curiosity of all the neighbouring gentry , was so highly raised , that many attempts had been made to get a sight of these fair recluses , but in vain ; for no mortal had ever seen <page type="Page 212"/> them , since their arrival there , though it was known they walked in their gardens every day .
</p>
<p>
Curiosity began now to operate upon Wilson , as much as romance had done before on me , and we resolved that we would take a peep at these voluntary votaries of Madam Diana , coute qui coute - Many and various were the schemes which we framed , and rejected , for the gratification of our idle and impertinent inquisitiveness , during the course of that night : we lay in the same room , in order to continue our consultations ; but when the dawn appeared , we were just as undetermined on what method to pursue , as we were at the moment we lay down .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 213"/> We rose , and called our host into council , who assured us that the castle was inaccessible , unless we were mad enough to venture our lives by swimming over a deep fossé , which defended it in front , or scrambling through a thicket of briars , which prevented our approach on the other side ; and that if we should even be able to subdue these difficulties , there was still an immense high wall to climb , which no man could get over without hazarding life or limb .
</p>
<p>
Opposition but increased our ardor , and we at last resolved to attempt the thicket , in preference to the fossé , as we thought we should make a better appearance in the eyes of these supposed charmers , even with our cloaths torn , than after emerging dripping wet out of <page type="Page 214"/> a dirty ditch .
- And by the way , Lucan , I think that all the water in and about Paris , wants washing , as was said once , by a witty friend of mine .
I never saw such a muddy puddle in my life , as their boasted Seine - The yellow Tiber , or the Bristol Severn , are crystal to it .
</p>
<p>
I will not detain you by repeating the fatigues and difficulties we suffered , in this attempt ; suffice it to say that our cloaths were torn , and our hands , legs , and faces , as much scratched , as if we had made a party on the pantiles with a groupe of amorous tabbies .
- But what are not patience and perseverance able to subdue ?
</p>
<p>
In short we scaled the walls , and seated ourselves in a good pleasant arbour , in <page type="Page 215"/> a corner of the garden , valuing ourselves on our heroic achievement , and impatiently expecting the reward of our toils , by being blest at last with a view of these fair vestals .
</p>
<p>
In a short time after we had made our lodgment in this redoubt , to our inexpressible delight , we heard the sound of female voices talking in a chearful lively tone ; and soon saw two ladies walking towards us , down an alley that fronted the harbour we were in .
</p>
<p>
But no language will ever be able to describe our amazement , when the speakers had advanced near enough to be clearly seen , and distinctly heard by us .
- No idea either of Venus or the Graces , or Diana and her Nymphs , will suit the description - But if you can rumage up <page type="Page 216"/> any recollection of Cybele , or for that matter you need not go so far back , as mother Shipton will serve as well , to represent the two old hags , that appeared then before us .
</p>
<p>
' `` It must be enchantment , '' ' said I , to Wilson .
- He replied , ' `` I see nothing enchanting about them ; they are both ugly and old . '' '
- ' `` No woman is old in France , remember that , Wilson ; or at least let us endeavour to persuade these grannams that we think so , for civility is the only passport by which we can hope to get over the drawbridge in safety . '
</p>
<p>
When they approached the arbour , perceiving us they started too , in their turn , and would have fled back , if their <page type="Page 217"/> old shanks had been supple enough to have corresponded with their fears ; but we soon quieted their apprehensions , by the mildness of our demeanour , and the frank confession we made of the romantic curiosity which had prompted us to this frolic .
</p>
<p>
Being thus recovered from this alarm , they both laughed immoderately at the aukward confusion which appeared in our faces ; and one of them , addressing us with infinite good humour and vivacity , said , ' `` We are extremely obliged to you gentlemen , or rather courteous knights , for the perils you have encountered , for our sakes ; and also for convincing us that the noble spirit of chivalry , is not yet quite extinct in the world .
Believe me , we wish rather more earnestly <page type="Page 218"/> than you , that we were possessed of those charms which you expected to have met with , in this galant adventure ; but youth and beauty are transitory things , and with them we have lost the admiration of your sex , and merely in sport had yet a mind to try if it was not still in our power to occasion a disappointment as great , though not indeed so severe , as any young and beautiful coquette might make her lover feel .
If I may judge by your countenances , I think we have so far succeeded ; and the only amends we can make you , for having sped our frolic , is to desire the favour of your company to dinner , and to promise to convey you back again , by a shorter and pleasanter road than you came , to Noisy le Sec , without any further damages than what the view of our persons seems <page type="Page 219"/> already to have made you pay for your peeping . '' '
</p>
<p>
You may suppose how confoundedly silly Wilson and I looked all this while ; but I was so much pleased with the spirit and good humour of this lively dowager , that I wished her thirty years younger , intirely for her own sake .
We accepted her invitation with the best grace we could , and entered into a very chearful conversation with them both , during which they discovered that we were Englishmen , and informed us , that they were our country-women .
The one , who seemed to take the lead in every thing , is a sister of Lord D - 's , and had been , while she lived in England , an intimate acquaintance of my mother 's - Who the other lady was , did not transpire .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 220"/> Before we parted , Wilson and I both promised her not to disclose their secrets , if she chose to carry on the jest for any further time ; but she gave us leave to publish it to our friends , if we pleased , as she meant to quit that place immediately ; said she and her companion were both tired of their voluntary confinement , and did not believe that , if they were to remain there seven years longer , any Frenchman would ever give himself as much trouble about them as we had had done .
</p>
<p>
I charged myself with some commissions , pour mes belles antiques , which I shall execute in England with the most knightly punctuality imaginable , and returned laughing to Paris , about an hour ago .
- Robert is arrived with my baggage : <page type="Page 221"/> I shall dress and go to the Comedie , though I believe it will be near over , before I get there .
</p>
<p>
As I am resolved to attend Sir George Cleveland 's motions , and that he seems to be upon the wing , I shall not expect to hear from you , while I remain upon the continent , but hope to find a pacquet from you , at my arrival in old England ; till then , adieu , my dear Lucan , says
</p>
<p>
yours , HUME .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 222"/> Southfield .
</p>
<p>
PLeasure !
Joy !
they are both inadequate to what I feel , from your account of Delia Colville !
my brother !
my beloved !
my happy brother !
what will his transports be !
He may certainly say , with Lord Townly , ' `` Long parted friends , that pass through common voyages in life , receive but common gladness at their meeting - But from a shipwreck saved !
we mingle tears with our embraces ! '' '
And surely the recovery , I might almost say the resurrection , of the beloved and lamented Delia , is a still higher cause for rapture .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 223"/> I should fear for his life , or senses , if this secret was in any other hands but yours - Yet even for you , I think it will be a difficult task to moderate his extasy - Were I now to meet him , I should fly into his arms , and cry out , She lives !
I know you will not do so ; but though you may restrain your tongue , will not your eyes betray the mighty joy ?
will they not sparkle with unusual lustre , and speak of Delia Colville ?
Mine do so at this moment , though their weak beams have long been quenched in tears .
- I wait impatiently for another letter from you - Do but tell me they have met , and my mind will be at peace , for I shall then suppose , that nought but death can part them .
</p>
<p>
I do not wish to mix one gloomy line with this joyful subject , I shall , therefore , <page type="Page 224"/> say little of myself .
- I am recovering from my late illness , though slowly ; Sir William is returned , in an alarming state ; he fell from his horse , about a fortnight ago ; his physician apprehends that he has received some inward hurt , as he spits blood ever since .
- My attention to him is unremitted , he seems pleased with it ; and I begin once more to flatter myself that my Fanny 's prediction may yet be verified .
</p>
<p>
Colonel Walter has renewed his visit , and made several attempts to speak to me alone , which I have happily evaded ; for when I am absent from Sir William , I take care to keep Harriet constantly with me - I perceive he is mortified at my caution , in which , however , I am determined to persevere .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 225"/> Last night , when our letters came from the post the Colonel took them from the servant , and conveyed one out of his pocket into the parcel : quick as his motions were , this action did not escape me ; and the moment I had received those that were addressed to me , I retired , and immediately enclosed the letter which bore no post mark on it , in a blank cover , directed to the Colonel , and ordered it to be instantly delivered to him .
When I returned into the parlour to supper , there were strong traces of resentment in his countenance , and he talked rather at , than to me , for the remainder of the evening .
</p>
<p>
This morning he went from hence , before I was up - Surely he will at length desist from an hopeless pursuit - Twice <page type="Page 226"/> have his detested and unsuccessful attempts brought me near the grave - Heaven preserve me from a third !
I shudder at the bare apprehension !
</p>
<p>
Your wishes with regard to my becoming Harriet 's confidante , are almost accomplished ; for she has confessed to me that she corresponded with Lord Lucan during my illness , and also that she concealed my danger from him , as she judged what his sufferings would be , on that occasion , by her own .
- Was ever any thing more truly delicate , than her endeavouring to save him pain ?
</p>
<p>
She offered to shew me his letters ; I refused to see them , and told her I had no doubt of his friendship for me , or the propriety and politeness of his <page type="Page 227"/> manners towards her , but that I could not help observing to her , as a friend , without the authority of a parent , that I feared there was something inconsistent with the strict rules of decorum , in her carrying on such a correspondence .
</p>
<p>
She blushed extremely , and I could perceive there was something more still labouring in her artless bosom - Lord Lucan 's picture came into my thoughts , at the same time , yet I had not resolution sufficient to ask her a single question relative to it .
</p>
<p>
After a minute 's silence , I saw that her face was bathed with tears , she caught my hand , and said , ' `` I have been much more imprudent , Madam , than you yet know of ; but if you will be my <page type="Page 228"/> friend , indeed - Alas !
I have no other !
and conceal what is past , from my uncle , I will tell you all my folly , and submit my future conduct to your direction . '' '
- I gave her every possible assurance that the tenderest friendship could suggest , and I know not which of us was most agitated during this scene - She owned her having lent my picture to Lord Lucan , at his most earnest intreaty , on condition that he should give her his ; that he had kept his promise , but that she had been so unfortunate as to lose his gift ; and that she had lived in perpetual apprehension , ever since , lest any accident might betray this act of indiscretion to her uncle , or to me .
- But that she still more dreaded its injuring Lord Lucan , by raising a suspicion of his being her lover , when heaven , and she could tell , he had not such a thought !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 229"/> Her colour rose to crimson , as she pronounced the last sentence with clasped hands and streaming eyes - I never beheld a more animated figure .
- Generous Harriet !
I said softly to myself , and my heart reverberated the sound - What pains has it cost her to defend the fidelity of the man she loves , to her rival !
- Yes , Fanny , I will emulate the virtue I admire ; every effort of my life shall be exerted to promote Harriet 's happiness , and from that pure and unsullied source I will endeavour to derive my own !
</p>
<p>
I confess I am pleased at being able to acquit Lord Lucan of the indiscretion of having made a confidante ; his picture must have fallen into the hands of Colonel Walter , when Harriet lost it , and the vile artful wretch contrived to place <page type="Page 230"/> it as a snare for me , and watched the moment .
</p>
<p>
How to recover it for the innocent owner , is now the question ?
I can not think of any prudent , and therefore possible means , of effecting this , at present .
I can neither ask it as a favour , with a safe condescension , nor demand it as a right , without danger .
</p>
<p>
The variety of distressful subjects with which my late letters have been filled , have so much engrossed my thoughts while writing to you , that I have never mentioned a circumstance which has given me sincere satisfaction , the recovery of Mr. Creswell , Lucy Leister 's lover - His father is since dead , by which he is now become Sir Harry Creswell - Ma chere amie <page type="Page 231"/> est au comble de ses voeux , but delays the completion both of her own and her lover 's happiness , till I am able to be present at the joining of those hands , whose hearts have long been united .
</p>
<p>
Sir William 's indisposition prevents me from having their nuptials celebrated here , as the custom of this country would , on that occasion , require such an exertion of what is called hospitality , which is another term for drinking , as might be prejudicial to him ; and my attendance on him restrains me from going up to Dublin to her , so that our wishes alone can attend upon this happy union .
</p>
<p>
Sir William is not calculated for solitude ; he is now debarred from field-sports , and every kind of exercise , and <page type="Page 232"/> he seeks for amusement from books , in vain - That taste which can alone render reading pleasant , or useful to us , must be acquired in youth ; the Muses , like the rest of their sex , resent neglect , and may be wooed , but not won , by those who only seek them as a supplement to more lively pleasures , ' `` Youth 's the season made for joy , '' ' and for literature also .
</p>
<p>
Colonel Walter 's housekeeper has been to visit Benson , several times of late , and has endeavoured , with a competent share of art , to discover how Mrs. Walter had escaped , and where she now is : you may suppose that she has not gained the wished-for intelligence - Benson would die sooner than betray me .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 233"/> Harriet and I have often wondered that no hint relative to Mrs. Walter has ever escaped the Colonel - I am sometimes tempted to think that he believes us ignorant of that affair ; but when I recollect his blushing , in the temple , upon some hint of mine relative to it , I change my opinion .
- What a heart must that man have !
How black !
and of course , how wretched !
I am inclined to believe , that the wicked expiate a great part of their sins , in this world , by their constant fear of detection .
</p>
<p>
Sir Arthur and Miss Ashford are often with us .
I begin to apprehend that she has a partiality for Colonel Walter , and am distressed how to act on this occasion - Should I speak of him as I think , she may attribute my sentiments , either <page type="Page 234"/> to private pique , or a general love of slander , as I am not at liberty to acquaint her with those facts , on which my dislike to him are too justly founded - Yet will it not be an act of baseness , to suffer this charming girl to throw away her affections on such a wretch ?
Think for me , Fanny , and direct me how to conduct myself , in this critical situation .
</p>
<p>
Give a thousand loves and congratulations for me , to my brother , and his
</p>
<p>
'' Latest found !
Heaven 's last , best gift ! ''
Wishes for their happiness must be superfluous , yet they have mine most truly - accept the same from your ever affectionate sister , LOUISA BARTON .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 235"/> P.S. I find I can not write a short letter to you - When I began this , I determined not to exceed a page , but , like Eloise ,
</p>
<p>
'' My heart still dictates , and my hand obeys . ''
And wherefore should I restrain them , or debar myself from the greatest satisfaction I enjoy ?
I am not good catholic enough to have faith in the merits of voluntary penances , especially as I feel that I am not without my share of those that are imposed on us - No works of supererogation for me - Once more , adieu .
<page type="Page 236"/> PARIS still , but on the point of quitting it , in a few hours .
- My brother arrived here , on Sunday night , and with him - but no matter - He is not of sufficient consequence to interrupt a narrative in which we are all so much interested .
- You may be curious tho ' - Lord Hume then came with Sir George , from Naples !
he has had a thousand ridiculous adventures in Italy - I have not seen him yet , and do not know when I shall .
</p>
<p>
My eyes , as you apprehended , certainly told tales ; for the moment Sir George saw me , he said there is a glad expression in my sister 's face , that would almost <page type="Page 237"/> tempt me to hope , beyond the bounds of reason ; but , alas !
Fanny , there is no redemption from the grave !
</p>
<p>
True , Sir George , I answered , but perhaps your treasure may not yet be consigned to that strong chest .
- He caught my hand , and pressing it to his heart , cried out , it is impossible that you should mean to trifle with my anguish !
Yet did she not expire at Amiens ?
</p>
<p>
She never was at Amiens , I replied - Where !
where then did her pure spirit take its flight , and quit her lovely form ?
- You must be more composed , Sir George , before I can talk further on this subject .
- Why was it started , Fanny ?
Why are my wounds all made to bleed afresh ?
Can you delight in cruelty !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 238"/> Far from it , you know how tenderly I sympathized with your distress , when I believed her dead - If there is a cause in nature , that can make you doubt it now , O !
speak it quickly , and ease my anxious heart !
</p>
<p>
I have strong reasons to believe she lives , or I should not thus have alarmed you - My friend , Mrs Walter , has seen and conversed with a young lady , of the name of Delia Colville , in a convent at Saint Omer 's , who may be her .
</p>
<p>
He dropped upon his knees - and exclaimed - Gracious Heaven !
but realize this blessed vision , let me no longer mourn my Delia 's loss , and unrepining will I then submit to all that fate or fortune can inflict upon my future days !
<page type="Page 239"/> Speak , speak on , my sister !
and say again that you believe she lives !
- Indeed I do believe so , my dear brother - He rose and caught me in his arms , while the large drops ran plenteous down his cheeks - Tears relieved us both .
</p>
<p>
I then proceeded to acquaint him with those circumstances which I have already informed you of ; as I thought I might now venture to speak to him with more certainty , and that I felt too much pain in keeping him longer doubtful - His transports increased , and it is utterly impossible to give any idea of the excess of his joy .
</p>
<p>
It was with difficulty I could prevent his going at midnight to Lord H - ; but though I prevailed on him to defer his <page type="Page 240"/> visit till morning , I could not persuade him to go to bed , or attempt to take any rest or food , except a little wine and water , and the whole night was spent in repeating what I had told him before , and re-reading Mrs. Walter 's letter .
</p>
<p>
Selfish mortal !
as he is , he barely mentioned his having extricated Lord Hume out of some doleful disasters , that befel him at Naples , in which an opera-singer was the principal performer .
- But what consequence could he suppose the story to be of , to me ?
</p>
<p>
Though I neither am , or ever mean to be connected with his Lordship , I am pleased that my brother saved his life , and that by his means he has got quit of an artful woman , who might probably <page type="Page 241"/> have ruined his fortune ; and I have a kind of satisfied pride also , in thinking that he is so much indebted to our family .
</p>
<p>
I am afraid there is something mean in the above reflection - but I am not now at leisure enough to trace it back to its source - at some other time I will fairly and philosophically investigate its nature , and receive or reject it , according as I find it derived from a good or bad origin .
</p>
<p>
Long before the ambassador 's servants were stirring , my brother attempted his door , and I think he returned three times before his excellency was visible .
As soon as he had acquainted him with his business , Lord H - very obligingly <page type="Page 242"/> set out with him , for Versailles , and has promised to get the order for Delia 's enlargement as much expedited as possible .
</p>
<p>
My brother , as you may suppose , remains in waiting , till it is finished , and is then to call on me , and fly to St. Omers , without staying for the return of the chancellor 's messenger from Toulouse .
I have sat all day in my travelling dress , as I would not delay him for any consideration .
</p>
<p>
I mentioned your joy on the recovery of Delia ; he returns your love , an hundred-fold , and says he will write both to you and Sir William , as soon as his spirits are a little more composed .
</p>
<p>
I fear to attempt answering my dear Louisa 's letter , at present , as I expect <page type="Page 243"/> to be summoned by my brother every instant .
</p>
<p>
His carriage turns into the porte cochere , this moment .
Adieu ,
</p>
<p>
ma tres chere soeur ,
</p>
<p>
F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
St. Omers .
</p>
<p>
THOUGH I have been here three days , my head is still giddy with the violent motion and emotion I have gone through , since I left Paris .
- We set out the moment I had sealed my last letter to you , and travelled with as much expedition as French roads , horses , and post-boys would permit .
Sir George <page type="Page 244"/> was determined to stop at Amiens , and notwithstanding the certain assurances I had given him that his Delia was alive , he seemed to be strongly agitated when we drove into the town .
</p>
<p>
He inquired from our landlord , whether he recollected a young English lady 's dying there , at such a time ?
And being answered in the affirmative , the colour forsook his cheek , he fell almost lifeless on a settee that was near him , and sighed out , ' `` Ah Fanny !
why have you deceived me ! '' '
</p>
<p>
I could not help being provoked at his weakness , and told him I did not know that he was to be a mourner for all the young English women that should die in France ; that I was perfectly convinced <page type="Page 245"/> Miss Colville was alive and well , or I should not have set out on our present expedition ; but if he was inclined to think otherways , he had better not pursue the journey any farther .
</p>
<p>
He replied , with his usual mildness -
</p>
<p>
'' Who loves must fear , '' And sure who loves like me , must greatly fear . ''
But my reliance on you has banished my apprehensions , and I now only desire to inquire into this affair , to know by what means Mrs. Colville could avail herself of a stranger 's death , to carry on the vile deceit she has practised .
Our host , like most others , was very well inclined to be communicative , and informed us of the following particulars ; that on such a day , the diligence that <page type="Page 246"/> goes to Paris , stopped at his house , and set down a very pretty young woman , who was so extremely ill , that she was not able to travel farther ; and that notwithstanding all possible care was taken of her , she expired on the fourth day after her coming there .
</p>
<p>
They had discovered before she died , that she was an English heretic , as she absolutely refused to let any of their clergy attend her during her illness ; but they knew not even her name , nor whom she belonged to ; and though her cloaths and effects were sufficient to defray the expences of her funeral , yet as she was not a catholic , she could not be interred in consecrated ground ; and mine host , to use his own phrase , said he was in a perfect quondary , to know how he should dispose of the body .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 247"/> But as good luck would have it , a lady and her maid arrived at his house the next day , in a post-chaise - As they were English , he acquainted them with his distress ; and the maid was sent to look at the dead person , in order to know if she could give any account of her - She returned to her mistress , and they were for some time shut up together - At last the lady herself went to look at this lifeless beauty , and the moment she saw her , she gave a loud scream , and ran back into her apartment .
</p>
<p>
Some time after , the maid called for him , and told him that it was her lady 's daughter who had died there , and gave some hints of her having eloped from her friends - She desired that every thing might be prepared in the best manner , <page type="Page 248"/> for sending the body to England ; and strictly charged him not to let any person go into the chamber where she lay , but those who were immediately concerned about the body .
</p>
<p>
She added , that he might dispose of the young lady 's effects as he thought proper , except a small trunk , which contained only a miniature picture , a pocket book , and some letters ; and the lady would pay all the necessary expences on this melancholy occasion .
- Every thing was then done as she directed , to the mutual satisfaction of mine host , and that burier of the living and robber of the dead , Mrs. Colville .
</p>
<p>
I have not now leisure to expatiate on this extraordinary coincidence of circumstances , <page type="Page 249"/> yet I must observe that fortune seemed inclined to favour Mrs. Colville 's deceit , by the particular situation of the young woman at Amiens , whose interment had imposed on all Delia 's friends , even on her lover , and prevented any further inquiry about her .
</p>
<p>
I dare say you are by this time very impatient to get us to our journey 's end ; but do n't be in a hurry , Louisa , for our haste in setting out before the next day occasioned a very disagreable delay , as it brought us to the gates of St. Omers , an hour after they were shut , and obliged us to pass a miserable night , in what they call an auberge , but in our country , I think it might more justly be stiled a barn .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 250"/> At last the wished-for morning came , and we pursued our way directly to the convent .
- It is impossible to give you any idea of my brother 's emotion - When we were shewn into the parlour , I desired to see the superior - I know that I must not stop here to give you a description of her person , but indeed she is a fine old lady .
</p>
<p>
As soon as she appeared , I delivered the king 's mandate to her , which she read with great dignity , but not without surprise ; and said if she had been imposed on , with regard to the young lady in question , she was not to blame ; and added that she was ready , on the instant , to obey the king 's order , by delivering Miss Colville to my care .
</p>
<p>
Sir George in a transport exclaimed , ' `` Let me but see her , Madam '' ' - There I <page type="Page 251"/> interposed my negative , for Delia 's sake , as I feared the effects which so unexpected an interview might have upon her spirits .
- It was therefore at last agreed to that I should go into another parlour , see Mrs. Walter , and send her to prepare Delia for such a joyful event .
</p>
<p>
Our amiable friend soon came to me , and I have the happiness to tell you , that she is most wonderfully recovered ; but , in pity to my brother 's impatience , I scarce waited to inquire her health , before I appointed her the messenger of glad tidings to our dear Delia .
</p>
<p>
She returned with her , in an instant ; but when the lovely girl beheld me , she could not speak ; she made an effort to put her hand through the grate , and funk down on a chair that stood near her - <page type="Page 252"/> Tears came to her relief , and she at last articulated , ' `` O , my beloved Fanny !
my more than sister ! '' '
At that word she blushed , and hid her face , as if to wipe away the tears .
</p>
<p>
I instantly replied , you are , my dear , the sister of my choice ; and by that tender name , and for my brother 's sake , I beg you to compose yourself - He is now in the house , and most ardently longs to see you , but must not be indulged at the expence of injuring your health , by an increase of agitation - If you were calm , he should appear this moment .
- I am quite calm , she said , and fainted away .
</p>
<p>
I do not think I was ever so terrified in my life - By the assistance of the nuns <page type="Page 253"/> she was brought to herself in about ten minutes , and , by the superior 's permission , Sir George was admitted into the parlour with me - I thought their meeting would have killed us all - Even an old nun wept , while she administered drops and water to the whole company .
- I feel myself too much affected , even at this instant , to be able to repeat the no-conversation that passed at the time .
Sir George embraced me , as if I had been his mistress , and Delia clung round Mrs. Walter 's neck , calling her deliverer , guardian angel !
&c..
</p>
<p>
When our transports had a little subsided , I proposed our adjourning to the inn , till we could be accommodated with private lodgings ; for we had before agreed to wait the return of the chancellor 's <page type="Page 254"/> messenger at St. Omers , as it was absolutely necessary that my brother should have a little rest , after his fatigue both of mind and body - But he was not fated to taste repose as speedily as I then hoped for .
</p>
<p>
I received Miss Colville in due form , from the hands of the superior , by whom many compliments and apologies were made to her late prisoner .
- Delia 's behaviour was charming , for instead of reproaches for the severity she had suffered , she returned thanks for the great care that had been taken of her , and took a most polite and even affectionate leave of the whole community .
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Walter and Olivia accompanied us to the inn , and we passed the day in <page type="Page 255"/> mutual congratulations , and in moralizing on the providential series of incidents that had procured Delia 's deliverance - But towards evening we all perceived a visible change in her countenance , and before midnight there appeared strong symptoms of a fever .
</p>
<p>
My brother was almost distracted ; my heart bleeds for him - Should she again be torn from his fond heart , I think it would be impossible that he should survive the second blow - But I will hope the best - He has not gone to bed , since we left Paris ; he never stirs from the ante-chamber of the room where she lies , and looks so dreadfully , that I am shocked at seeing him .
</p>
<p>
The physicians here say that she is not in danger , but they are so miserably <page type="Page 256"/> ignorant , that I can not rely on their judgment in a case where I am so sincerely interested .
Mrs. Walter and I sit up by turns , and never leave the dear invalid a moment ; I fear she suffers from her concern for us , but she promises , and I hope will perform her engagement , to be well in a few days .
</p>
<p>
On the very day that we took her out of the convent , there came a letter from her mother , intreating the superior to send Delia to some other nunnery , and charging her to deny her ever having been there , to any person who should inquire after her .
- Thank God , we have counter-acted her wicked scheme , and I trust he will restore her to our prayers and wishes !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 257"/> Again excuse me , my Louisa , for not entering upon the subjects mentioned in your last letter , as the present situation of our beloved brother , and adopted sister , engrosses all my thoughts , and I can not even allow a minute 's attention to what appears a very extraordinary circumstance , which is Lord Hume 's following us from Paris , and lodging directly opposite to us , at St. Omers !
He sends five or six times a day to inquire Delia 's health , and writes a letter once a day to Sir George .
</p>
<p>
I ca n't help being pleased with this appearance of attention and good-nature to my brother , and at the proper respect he shews , in not taking the advantage which he might , of obtruding himself into my presence , under pretence of visiting his friend .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 258"/> Why , O why , has he foolishly deprived himself and me , of what once appeared to have been so great a pleasure to us both !
But that is past - I do not , nor I will not , think of him -
</p>
<p>
Adieu , my dearest sister ,
</p>
<p>
F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
P.S. .
You know that Sir George , Mrs. Walter , Delia , and Olivia , all love you , forgive me then for uniting their affections with mine , and presenting them in one bouquet together , instead of offering them to your acceptance in detached sprigs .
</p>
<p>
Delia has slept all the time I have been writing ; she wakes this moment ; she is much refreshed - I fly to tell Sir George .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 259"/> St. Omers .
</p>
<p>
OUR fears have been much increased for Delia 's life , since I wrote last , but , thank Heaven , they are now happily over ; her disorder turned out to be the measles : the physicians have pronounced her out of danger , and all our spirits are attuned to the sweet harmony of love and joy - If I had not been witness of them , I should not easily have credited an account of the extravagancies which Sir George was guilty of , during her illness .
</p>
<p>
I find , Louisa , that when these philosophic gentlemen are thrown the least <page type="Page 260"/> out of their bias , they are not a bit more steady than ourselves ; and ' `` Hang up philosophy '' ' should be the motto of them all , whenever their passions are thoroughly interested .
- But not to treat my brother too severely , his was a very particular case ; and had his treasure been snatched from his arms , almost in the moment he had recovered it , the trial would , I think , have been too severe for human fortitude .
</p>
<p>
The messenger returned from Toulouse while Delia was in the utmost danger ; we did not therefore at that time trouble ourselves to inquire what Mrs. Colville had said , or done , on this extraordinary occasion ; but we are since informed , that she absolutely insists on her daughter 's being dead and buried , and denies <page type="Page 261"/> her having placed her in the convent - It is shocking to think how very near she was to speaking truth , at the very time she uttered this falsehood .
</p>
<p>
She sent off another express to the superior of the Ursulines , with a letter to tell her , that more than her life depended on her steadiness in denying her ever having received Delia into the convent ; and promising to give a thousand guineas to the foundation , provided she took care to secrete her effectually .
</p>
<p>
The good old lady has put this letter into my brother 's possession , and he in return , has made a present to the sisterhood of five hundred pounds .
- This paper would be proof sufficient against Mrs Colville , if we had not a still more <page type="Page 262"/> undoubted evidence in the person of our dear Delia .
</p>
<p>
The moment her health is established , we shall return to England , and , notwithstanding my joy at her recovery , shall quit St. Omers with regret , as I can not prevail on my beloved Mrs. Walter to accompany us .
- She and her sweet little girl are perfectly idolized in the convent ; and I fear if Mrs. Walter 's situation would admit of her taking the veil , that she would certainly pass the remainder of her days in that quiet asylum .
</p>
<p>
To prevent this , I wish long life to the most worthless being upon earth - I should not specify Colonel Walter here , if Mrs. Colville were not alive .
- I wish they were married together , and then I <page type="Page 263"/> am pretty sure there is not a pair , in the drawing-room of Pandaemonium , that would not readily give them due place and precedence - But I will have done with these infernals - and now for your long , too long unanswered letter .
</p>
<p>
I hope by this time Sir William 's recovery has removed the anxiety you must necessarily feel on his illness , and released you from a confinement that might possibly injure your health - Were it not for these considerations , I know of few offices more pleasing than attending a person we love , in slight disorders - There is something extremely flattering to a generous mind , in the idea of administering relief to another 's pains - To
</p>
<p>
'' Explain the thought , explore the asking eye ! ''
What a delightful employment !
and when crowned with success by the recovery <page type="Page 264"/> of our patient , we are conscious of a certain exultation in the mind , which can only arise from the certainty of having done what nature claims , and charity enjoins .
</p>
<p>
I have of late experienced great pleasure in the execution of this duty , from my attendance on Mrs. Walter , and Delia , and am therefore inclined to elevate the office of nurse-tending , by placing it amongst our rational pleasures , and rescuing it from the mean character of one of the mere duties of life .
</p>
<p>
Yet I fear I shall make but few converts to my opinion ; especially amongst the gay world , who , looking upon it in such a servile light , rank it with fasting , penitence and prayer ; and too often postpone them together , till they may <page type="Page 265"/> need them all themselves , and then are left , in their turn , to the care of servants and other mercenaries .
- Mais assez sur ce point .
</p>
<p>
If Miss Ashford be a woman of sense , you run no hazard in trusting her with your opinion of Colonel Walter , though she were ever so much in love : - If she be weak , she stands more in need of such a friendly warning ; and if she should break with you , in consequence of it , I think you may easily console yourself for the loss of such an acquaintance , by reflecting that you acted from a spirit of friendship , of which she has shewn herself unworthy .
</p>
<p>
I perfectly approve of your conduct towards the person himself ; and am , for your sake , glad to exculpate Lord Lucan <page type="Page 266"/> from the weakness , might I not add the dishonour , of having made a confidant .
- What a charming girl is our Harriet !
- I must call her so ; for indeed , I have a very great claim to her affection , from having , unsolicited , bestowed so large a portion of mine on her , which I hope , when she is Lady Lucan - do n't start , Louisa - and her heart quite at ease , she will generously repay .
</p>
<p>
Now , pray let me be indulged in talking a little of myself , et mon pauvre amant humilié et humiliant , - for I believe one , and confess the other .
- My brother has informed me of Lord Hume 's misadventures at Naples ; the particulars of which I shall not trouble you with at present , as they are nothing different from the too general pranks and hazards of youthful spirits , and may serve us better <page type="Page 267"/> to laugh at , on the first tête-a-tête we may ever have the pleasure of enjoying together .
</p>
<p>
I bestow a generous wish that Sir George 's notion about this matter may prove true ; that as he has not only seen , but felt , his folly and extravagance , he may be more likely to act prudently , for the rest of his life , than if he had never erred .
</p>
<p>
This is a maxim universally propagated , and may in some instances be true ; but I can scarce think it a sufficient foundation for a woman of sense , to build her happiness on - To a man who has been accustomed to the artful blandishments of an abandoned woman , I should much fear that the delicate endearments of a <page type="Page 268"/> wife would appear as tasteless and insipid , as true wit to the epigrammatist , or the sweetest viand to the spiced palate .
</p>
<p>
But all this is merely matter of speculation , and of no manner of consequence to me ; for Lord Hume has never yet attempted to pay me a visit , either at Paris , or here ; and Sir George has not hitherto been in a situation to invite him , especially as , from a very proper delicacy , he has never acquainted him with the circumstances of Miss Colville 's story ; and though we set out from Paris at the same time , he kept different stages from us , all the way .
</p>
<p>
The account that my brother has just given me of that particular , is this , that they had agreed at Naples , to travel together <page type="Page 269"/> to England , but on their arrival at Paris , and his hinting to him that I had come to meet him there , on account of some singular piece of business or other , he had immediately estranged himself from any further connection with him ; saying , after his lively manner , that as he looked upon himself to be in the nature of a redeemed knight , he thought it his bounden duty to attend his deliverer , in the quality of an humble ` squire , till he had escorted him safe into his own country ; but should wait upon him at such a respectful and unprying distance , as might leave the privacy , both of his conversation and transactions , perfectly free from any manner of restraint .
</p>
<p>
My brother , you know , was abroad , when our affections commenced and <page type="Page 270"/> grew together , while I was under the matronage of my aunt Marriot ; when he returned , I had not courage enough to acquaint him with a secret , which would better have become Lord Hume himself to have informed him of , as they have ever lived on the most friendly terms together ; and in the present situation of the affair , it would be extremely indiscreet and absurd to breathe the least hints of it now .
</p>
<p>
Our childish affections , as they must naturally be formed without judgment , are generally unfortunate attachments , as they sometimes leave such traces on the heart , as a long life of maturer reason can scarcely wear away ; and to you I will not blush to own , that were it not for that fatal letter which Lord Hume wrote <page type="Page 271"/> to me from Naples , and which is as indelibly engraved on my heart as the first impression he made there , I could again be weak enough , were he to solicit it , to reassume those rosy fetters which I fancied our juvenile hands had formed sufficiently strong to hold us both for life .
- But that letter , Louisa !
I can not forget it - I must therefore try to forget the writer of it !
</p>
<p>
I am , however , vastly pleased with the delicacy of his present behaviour .
- I told you , in my last , that he lodges opposite to us ; he is generally planted at his window , but whenever I approach mine , he bows and retires immediately .
- He has , it seems , no kind of business in this place , but stays here from the mere possibility of his being in some degree , or by some <page type="Page 272"/> chance or other , useful to my brother , to whom he thinks himself everlastingly indebted for his kindness to him at Naples .
</p>
<p>
Gratitude can not exist in a base mind .
- How then can gratitude and ingratitude subsist in the same heart ?
- How can the same man run so far in arrear to the account of love , and be so ready to overpay the debt of friendship ?
Were he a man hackneyed in the ways of the world , I should not be so much surprised at this inconsistency of character .
</p>
<p>
Men of galantry , I have heard , consider women as bigotted catholics do heretics , and hold no faith with them ; - And that sweet line which Shakespeare has put into the mouth of the innocent <page type="Page 273"/> Juliet , is repeated , with perhaps an equal degree of contemptible exultation , by the abandoned courtier , and the apeing cit ,
</p>
<p>
'' At lovers perjuries , they say , Jove laughs . ''
But Lord Hume is young , and youth is the spring of virtue ; at least it is the season when we are most liable to feel '' The compunctious visitings of Nature , '' in consequence of our trespassing against her laws , by injuring the peace or happiness of others .
But I am myself trespassing against her first emotion , that of self-preservation , by dwelling on a subject which must for ever be productive of pain , notwithstanding my repeated efforts to blunt the arrow 's point .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 274"/> I congratulate you on the near prospect of happiness which opens to your friend , Miss Leister - May it terminate in the possession of all her wishes !
I hope she is by this time Lady Creswell ; and that my sweet little Harriet had the pleasure and honour of being her paranymph - I consider this office as a step to advancement , and I suppose most young ladies are of my opinion , as they are generally very desirous of it .
</p>
<p>
I think I have now , though slightly , touched upon every article of your last letter ; and I hope to find a pacquet from you , at my return to Dover-street , and that soon , very soon after , I shall be able to give you an account of the joining of a pair , whose hearts are , I believe , as firmly united , as any that ever took <page type="Page 275"/> hands , from the first wedding in Eden , down to this present day .
</p>
<p>
Adieu , my dear Louisa ; you are loved and remembered by all here , but by none more affectionately than
</p>
<p>
F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
St. Omers .
</p>
<p>
HERE I am , and here , like a fool as I am , I have been loitering , these three weeks , without any kind of business or pleasure to pursue , or even a creature to converse with , except honest old Saunders , who wonders mightily at my lordship , for passing my time so lonesomely , as he phrases it .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 276"/> You will , perhaps , wonder too , till I inform you that I have the pleasure of seeing Fanny Cleveland , every day - Do n't envy me , Lucan !
for I am only permitted to gaze at her , across the street , where we both live , at present - I wish I had a little of the fascinating power of the basilisk in my eyes , that might make the dear girl throw herself into my arms ; and may I perish if I would injure her , when she was folded there .
</p>
<p>
But how came I here in the midst of my friends , alone , you 'll be curious enough to ask ?
To which I can make no other answer than to repeat the hint I gave you , from Paris , with regard to some mystery or other , relative to Sir George 's concerns .
It can not be any affair of galantry , or a sister would not be <page type="Page 277"/> his confidante - it can not be a business of honour , or I should probably have been let into the secret - we may fairly conclude then , that it must certainly be some second love engagement , or other , of difficulty , which his romantic punctilio may not leave him yet at liberty to divulge - For he appeared to be one of the knights of the sorrowful countenance , as well as your lordship , when I met him first at Naples - However that matter may be , I have taken care , ever since his reserved communication to me , never to distress him by my visits ; and though we travel the same road together , I may be rather said to attend on , than accompany him , all the way .
</p>
<p>
I remember when my infatuation for Margarita was at the height , your <page type="Page 278"/> telling me that I loved Fanny Cleveland notwithstanding - I was surprised at an assertion then , which I now find to be true - But allowing this fact , which I suppose she must be certain of , as well as you , by my hankering after her at this rate , and the timid respect I treat her with , from my window , which is directly opposite to her 's -
</p>
<p>
'' Tell me my heart , if this be love . ''
Do n't you think she uses me rather too severely ?
But all lover 's are unreasonable - and false one 's deserve mortification .
Though perhaps it may be my own fault that I am kept thus aloof ; for I am such a bashful penitent , that I have not courage enough to desire leave to <page type="Page 279"/> wait on her , though surely some favourable interval might be contrived , even amidst the occupation of the most secret family intercourse , to afford sufficient leisure for the common decencies of friendship , or politeness .
</p>
<p>
I would give any consideration that the [ ... ] rst interview was over , end as it may ; but I do noturge it , though I am convinced that Sir George knows nothing , either of the engagements , or the breach , between his sister and me - I wish I could pluck up heart of grace enough to tell him all about it .
For , as I told you before , he is a very sensible man ; and though he had lately some honourable attachment or other , and may perhaps have entered into a new one since - without any manner of imputation - for <page type="Page 280"/> constancy to the grave , is both madness and folly - yet I think it is at least ten to one , that he has had some little gayeté de coeur , in the Margarita stile , himself , at some time of his life , and therefore would not make such a fuss about a man 's having strayed a little out of his road , on a common , as his prudish sister might do , who to be sure , like all other Dianas , steers exactly by rule and compass .
</p>
<p>
I wish you were here , this moment , to advise me how to conduct myself under my present difficulty , for I am in confounded aukward circumstances ; and though you pretend to be a much modester youth than me , I will be hanged , were you in my situation , if you would not extricate yourself much easier than I can possibly contrive to do .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 281"/> But whither has my former undaunted spirit taken its flight to , of late ?
I had once the courage to give a bold affront , and yet tremble now at the justice of asking pardon for it - Thus conscience , conscience , Lucan , makes cowards of us all .
</p>
<p>
If they get over to England before I have obtained leave to wait on Miss Cleveland , it is all over with me ; for I may visit Sir George seven years , and never see his sister .
My last resource must be to get into the same pacquet-boat with her , and pray most devoutly for a good storm , in our passage , that we may be cast away , and that I may have an opportunity , like Jaffier -
</p>
<p>
'' To save her life , with half the loss of mine ! ''
Or else , that the waves may swallow me <page type="Page 280"/> and my folly together , and so leave no trace behind of your affectionate friend , HUME .
</p>
<p>
P.S. .
You are so confoundedly dry , and uncommunicative , that I have left off asking you any more questions about your mistress - If she should turn out a diavola , like mine - I mean Margarita - I am sure you wo n't be such a simpleton as to tell me ; and yet it would be but good-natured of you , to let me laugh in turn .
</p>
<p>
Write to me , however , and direct to Almack 's ; for I hear we are all to set out for old England next week .
</p>

Omer 's still , and my tutelar Saint shall Omer be , as long as I exist - Little did I think , my dear Lucan , when I concluded my last letter , that I should write to you again from this place , where the dull uniformity of my life seemed nothing calculated to afford the least subject matter for another line ; but chance - how much are we all indebted to chance !
- has happily furnished me with materials sufficient to write an epic poem , if I were but as good a poet Homer as , who must certainly have taken his name from this place - H non est litera , you know - For I insist upon it , that the burning of three real good and substantial houses in this <page type="Page 284"/> town , is to the full as interesting a subject , to all mortals now living , as the famous conflagration of his imaginary Troy .
</p>
<p>
I further affirm , that Helen was but a sun-burnt dowdy , to the lovely Fanny Cleveland , whom I , happier far than any hero , living or dead , have just now rescued from the flames !
and that the gentle Delia Colville is much handsomer than Madam Andromache , who , I think , ranked next to her in beauty ; that Sir George Cleveland is as brave as Hector ; and that your friend Hume , is at least as much in love as monsieur Paris : I do not mean either the Taylor , or the Saint of that name , but the very identical Trojan , with whom Leda 's daughter ventured herself on ship-board , as my adorable Fanny will presently with me .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 285"/> May prosperous gales attend our Argos ; a richer sure than ever sailed from Colchis !
for I do not now stand in need of the machinery of a storm - The glorious element of fire has purged away my foulness , and , like the asbestos , I am rendered pure again .
My Fanny , too , rises a new-born phoenix from her nest .
</p>
<p>
I am in such spirits , Lucan , that I find it impossible to give you a rational account of this charming adventure - Suffice it then to say , that I had the happiness - that expression is too faint - anagogy * is the word - to save my Fanny 's life !
may I not add - I dare not pronounce it - She must , she will be grateful ; in her soft looks and downcast eyes , I read my pardon signed - The regards <page type="Page 286"/> of anger are erect and fierce ; those of disdain , oblique and scornful - But Fanny 's eyes !
they never were so beautiful as now - scarce raise their lovely lids , and only sparkle through their sable fringe , like stars in a clear sky .
- I think that is a poetical image ; beat it , Lucan , and I 'll allow you to be about half as much in love as I am .
</p>
<p>
I can not stay to scribble any more to you , rejoice with me , congratulate me , and believe me yours , sincerely
</p>
<p>
HUME .
</p>
<p>
P.S. .
If I ever recover my wits again , I 'll deal out the particulars of my trial ordeal - but believe me I would prefer my present inebriation to all the sober sense that ever was , from Solomon down to Samuel - need I add the sir-name of Johnson here ?
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 287"/> I Received both your letters , my dear Hume , by the same pacquet , and as I think it much pleasanter to congratulate than condole , I shall only reply to the last of them ; for if you are , as I now begin to think , a true lover , your present happiness must have banished every trace of your former disquiet .
</p>
<p>
You have , indeed , my lively friend , been mightily indebted to chance , and I hope you will pardon me for saying , that it has done more in your favour than you had any right to have hoped for - But you careless fellows sometimes profit more by getting into scrapes , than we sober ones do by keeping out of them .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 288"/> I think it requires the utmost effort of disinterested friendship , not to envy you the happiness of having been serviceable to the woman you love - And such a woman too !
whose generous nature can be softened into a forgiveness of injuries , by the small merit of having done an act , that any man in the world , though not a lover , would have been proud to have performed .
But who is Delia Colville , pray ?
This is another personage added to your former drama - being her first appearance on the stage - But she must be the new mistress of Sir George , I suppose , whom you hinted at before , and so that mystery is unravelled at last .
</p>
<p>
Helas !
que mon sort est plus bizarre - The object of my adoration has been ill , dangerously ill , for some time ; and I <page type="Page 289"/> have not even dared to express my sorrow for her sufferings , or relieve my anxiety by incessant and minute inquiries about her health - We are many , many miles , asunder , almost at the opposite extremes of this kingdom ; and I am debarred even the poor indulgence of lamenting by secret correspondence , the pangs I hourly feel from absence - But she is the ruler of my destiny , and I will not murmur or repine at whatever she shall ordain .
</p>
<p>
Do I not then deserve that chance or fortune should do something in favour of such an humble and patient sufferer , as I am ?
- Yet what can it do for me !
circumstanced as my unhappy passion is , it must be criminal even to hope that those insuperable bars which now <page type="Page 290"/> divide us , should ever be removed - And yet my weak , my guilty heart , even at this moment , feels a gleam of joy , in thinking that there is a chance , which soon may set her free - Let me not dwell upon the subject , or breathe a wish that must render me unworthy of her .
</p>
<p>
I have received an invitation to attend the nuptials of an intimate friend of mine , who has been long in love with a very amiable young woman , but till now , ' `` With-held by parents . '' '
- Though utterly unfit for any scene of festivity , I can not refuse this summons , as I am truly interested in the happiness both of the bride and bridegroom - I shall , therefore , set out immediately for Dublin .
The wedding will be celebrated <page type="Page 291"/> a few miles from it ; but direct to me there .
</p>
<p>
And if you have yet descended from your hyperbolical heights , pray let me have a simple news-paper paragraph about the fire , and the facts that attended it .
Your hopeless state has been bettered , I find , by the same unnatural means that the wretched farmers of this country use with their land ; when their crops begin to grow thin , they burn it .
But you are a lucky fellow in every thing - Even your ill behaviour to Miss Cleveland , turns out now to your advantage - A woman affords an irrefragable proof of her love , who forgives such an affront ; for if she does , believe me , that 't is her own passion , not your chivalry , that has recovered her to you .
</p>
<p>
Adieu ,
</p>
<p>
LUCAN .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 292"/> Elm grove near Dublin .
</p>
<p>
THANK you , my Fanny , for the pleasure I have received from all your letters , but particularly for the last , which announces the glad tidings of Delia 's recovery , of my brother 's approaching happiness , and of your return to England .
</p>
<p>
You will see , by the date of this , that I have made an excursion from Southfield , since my last - Sir William , who is now , I hope , in a fair way of recovery , has at last consented to Lucy 's most earnest and repeated request , and has kindly permitted me to attend her nuptials <page type="Page 293"/> - He intends to pass the time of my absence with Colonel Walter - I am sorry he has chosen him for his companion , but what arguments could I oppose to his inclinations ?
</p>
<p>
On my arrival in Dublin , yesterday morning , I was met by my beloved Lucy , and her beloved lover - I never saw delicate happiness so strongly impressed upon elegant features , as it appeared in both their countenances ; yet there was a little mixture of timidity in Lucy 's eyes , which abated their vivacity , but encreased that charming look of sensibility which is the natural result of refined tenderness - the most irresistible of female charms .
</p>
<p>
Harriet , who came with me , is in high spirits ; she is to have the honour <page type="Page 294"/> you wished her , of being bride-maid , on this occasion - Young girls are always delighted at the prospect of a wedding , and consider that most solemn and hazardous act of our lives merely as a festival - When , alas !
- But this wedding will , I hope , and believe , justify their opinion , and make a holiday for both their lives .
Amen , Isay , with all my heart !
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Layton , Lucy , Harriet , and I , came here yesterday , in my coach .
This morning I have been all about the place , and never saw a sweeter spot ; the prospects are delightful ; there is an ample view of the bay of Dublin , and of the opposite hills , which for many miles are richly cultivated and adorned with numberless gardens and villas - There <page type="Page 295"/> is nothing in the environs of London , half so beautiful ; as neither the Thames or Medway , can pretend to vie , in beauty or in grandeur , with the ocean .
</p>
<p>
This lovely seat Sir Harry Creswell has just purchased , and settled it as a jointure house , on my fair friend ; leaving his family-mansion to descend in the usual course , to his heirs male .
- I am pleased with the propriety and delicacy of this action , as I have always thought it extremely cruel that a woman should be obliged to quit her house , on the death of her husband , and be as it were turned adrift in the world , at the time she has lost her chief stay and support in it .
</p>
<p>
Sir Harry is to dine with us here , this day , and to go back to Dublin , <page type="Page 296"/> which is just six miles off , at night : tomorrow he returns here again , to part from his Lucy no more .
The ceremony is then to be performed in a neat private chapel within the demesne - Miss Creswell , a sister of Sir Harry 's , is to be the other bride-maid ; and his bride-men , whoever they are to be , will I suppose , attend him hither .
</p>
<p>
I hear a carriage driving furiously , and am not yet dressed - It must be Sir Harry - Lovers are impatient - 'T is he , indeed ; but can I believe my sight ?
Lord Lucan with him !
My fate pursues me !
O Fanny !
I can write no more .
</p>
<p>
Adieu ,
</p>

<p>
THE HISTORY OF LADY BARTON .
</p>
<p>
THE moment I had laid down my pen , Harriet flew into my room , to express her surprise at Lord Lucan 's arrival ; but joy was much more predominant than wonder , in her artless eyes - Lucy came into my chamber , soon after , to assure me that she did not know of his Lordship 's coming , or even that he was an acquaintance of Sir Harry 's , till he introduced him to her , that instant , below stairs .
Harriet replied , with unusual <page type="Page 2"/> vivacity , ' `` Surely , Miss Leister , you need not make an apology for such an agreeable addition to our society , as Lord Lucan ? '' '
The moment these words had escaped her , her face was covered with blushes .
</p>
<p>
I took not the least notice of her emotion , though it struck me strongly , when contrasted with the different sensations of fear and anxiety that affected my heart .
A thousand disagreeable thoughts rushed at once into my mind ; I determined , however , to act with the utmost circumspection , and carefully to avoid any particular interview or conversation with his Lordship .
</p>
<p>
I did not quit my chamber till dinner was served ; - I spent the intermediate <page type="Page 3"/> hour extremely ill , in forming set speeches , and fashioning my conduct to impossible rules , which all vanished out of my thoughts , like a dream , the moment I beheld Lord Lucan ; and I suppose that no creature could ever have appeared more completely embarrassed upon any occasion .
</p>
<p>
His countenance , upon seeing me , was expressive of the sincerest delight ; there was a brilliancy in his eye , and a liveliness in his complexion , which would have made the homeliest features pleasing - Alas !
his wanted not this adventitious aid .
-
</p>
<p>
My confusion soon became contagious , and seemed to throw a general damp upon the spirits of the whole company - <page type="Page 4"/> Even the happy Creswel abated of his chearfulness , and often sent forth a look of inquiry , to try if he could discover the cause of his own change , in Lucy 's now altered countenance .
</p>
<p>
I could not help perceiving the gloom I had spread , and endeavoured , but in vain , to rally my spirits : - they were sunk too low to be recalled .
- I would have retired , but that would have been an addition to my friend 's distress - We made a dull and silent meal , and I quitted the table the moment it was possible .
</p>
<p>
I withdrew immediately to my chamber , and begged to be left alone - I was indulged by Lucy , though unwillingly .
I tried to account to myself for the uncommon heaviness which oppressed my <page type="Page 5"/> heart .
- The weakness of my past conduct appeared in the most glaring light to me ; and , from the agonies of remorse which I then felt , I concluded myself the most guilty of wretches .
-
</p>
<p>
Yet my reason revolted against this opinion , but was still utterly unable to banish it , or to account for the sudden change in my sentiments upon this subject , as no alteration had happened , either in Lord Lucan 's conduct , or my situation , from the time that I had considered my attachment to him as perfectly innocent , because it was absolutely involuntary - I became almost distracted with my doubts ; and , traversing my chamber with hasty steps , I exclaimed , how poor , how insufficient is human reason , either <page type="Page 6"/> to direct our actions , or restrain our passions !
</p>
<p>
O Thou , that stillest the raging of the sea !
and calmest the fury of the winds !
abate this conflict in thy creature 's breast !
and point the way in which my feet should tread to find the paths of peace !
- A sudden gush of tears followed this ejaculation , my mind grew calm , and I thought I could at that instant have taken an everlasting leave of Lord Lucan , with the most perfect resignation .
</p>
<p>
I continued musing upon the subject of my future conduct , for a long time ; and at last determined , that I would endeavour to assume as much chearfulness as possible , while I remained at Elm-grove ; that , in a very few days after the wedding , <page type="Page 7"/> I would return to Southfield , but , before I went , write a letter to Lord Lucan , fully expressive of the change in my sentiments with regard to him , or rather myself , enjoining him to make no reply , nor attempt ever to see me more .
</p>
<p>
Soon after I had formed this resolution , Lucy tapped softly at my chamber-door .
- She saw I had been weeping , but as I smiled , and held out my hand on her approach , she said my face might be compared to an April day , but as sunshine seemed now to prevail she hoped there would be no more showers - we joined the company , and I with pleasure perceived that I was much less constrained in my manner to Lord Lucan , and every body else , than I had been at dinner .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 8"/> A little flight of Sir Harry 's , at the time that the gentlemen were to leave us , and return to town , threw me into a second embarrassment - he insisted upon his being permitted to salute all the ladies , as he should never be another night a bachelor ; and that Lord Lucan , and a young gentleman , whose name is Weston , and was then present , should salute Miss Leister , as she should not chuse to spare them one of her kisses , when he should have an exclusive right to the sole property of them .
</p>
<p>
Young Weston , who , perhaps , mistakes vivacity for good breeding , proposed this folly 's becoming general , and it was impossible to object seriously to a matter that appeared so very trifling ; especially upon such an occasion as this <page type="Page 9"/> - Once at a wedding , you know , is a proverb .
</p>
<p>
Yet neither you , nor any of that company , will , I hope , ever know the pangs I felt at receiving a kiss from Lord Lucan .
- It seemed to cost him almost as much pain as it did me , for he trembled as if he had been seized with an ague-fit .
- The consent of my heart shocked me with a consciousness of guilt .
- I am sorry the foolish affair happened - but I will think no more of it .
</p>
<p>
It is now near two o ' clock in the morning of Lucy 's wedding-day ; and as I suppose I shall not have much leisure , for some time to come , I would not omit , before I lay me down to rest , if that may be , acquainting my dear confessor <page type="Page 10"/> and counsellor with the state of that heart , which , while it beats , will ever retain the tenderest affection for her .
</p>
<p>
Every good wish attends my brother ; and I hope I may by this time add , his amiable wife .
- My Fanny 's claim to that title , is , I think and hope , not far distant .
</p>
<p>
The renewal of Lord Hume 's connections with Sir George might have been merely accidental ; but his continuing them in the manner he has done , even to the incumbrance of my brother , in his present circumstances , speaks the revival of his attachment to you much stronger than the most direct and formal proposition could possibly have done .
- His attorney might perform the one , but his <page type="Page 11"/> passion only could be capable of the other .
</p>
<p>
Lord Hume has his merits as well as his faults ; and the mild eye of my sister 's charity is ever more open to the former than the latter ; and , if the union I have hinted at should take place , I trust they will become every day more conspicuous .
</p>
<p>
Adieu , my Fanny .
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
P.S. Eight o ' clock in the morning .
- I have passed a miserable night - disturbed slumbers , and terrifying dreams - If I were superstitious , I should imagine some ill fate awaits me - Alas !
how totally unfit am I for the festivity of a bridal day !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 12"/> OUR wedding , my Fanny , was conducted with the greatest propriety and elegance ; there were eighteen persons present , the eldest of whom , Mrs. Layton excepted , was not eight and twenty .
- Pleasure sat smiling on every placid brow ; even I endeavoured to assume an air of chearfulness , but thought myself , like Lucifer in heaven , unblessed amidst the blessed !
</p>
<p>
It is said that every woman looks better on her wedding-day , than any other of her life .
- I confess I never saw Lady Creswel appear so beautiful ; there was a sort of serene happiness in her countenance , <page type="Page 13"/> which I know not how to describe ; her clear brown complexion appeared almost transparent , yet was often heightened to the most becoming blush , by the fond looks of her enamoured bridegroom .
</p>
<p>
The dress of all brides is nearly the same ; - you may therefore conclude , that Lady Creswel wore white and silver .
- The bride-maids were dressed exactly alike , par hazard , in pale pink and silver .
- My cloaths were - Gracious heaven !
how can I write about such trifling matters , while my heart is breaking ?
- I must fly , my Fanny !
for ever fly from the sight of one , who becomes every hour more dangerous to my repose !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 14"/> We have now been three days together under the same roof , yet have I been lucky enough to avoid any particular conversation with Lord Lucan .
- He perceives my caution ; his vanity is doubtless flattered by it , yet he affects to appear unhappy ; his looks are expressive of the tenderest sorrow , and he sometimes gazes on me till he seems to have lost himself .
</p>
<p>
Poor Harriet watches his eyes - alas !
they are but seldom turned on her !
If he is really as wretched as he seems , he is to the full as much to be pitied as myself .
- Why did we ever meet ?
or , why not sooner ?
That heart which , in spite of the restraint of duty , is but too much devoted to him now , had it been free , my sister - I fear 't is criminal to indulge <page type="Page 15"/> this fond idea - I will suppress it then .
</p>
<p>
I have not had leisure to begin the letter I intend to write to him ; but to morrow , or the next day - in short , before I seal this , I will .
- And yet , what can I say to him ?
- Have I ought to complain of in his conduct , that can warrant an everlasting breach between us ?
- Has he not kept within the bounds prescribed by me ?
Has he even presumed to hint he thinks them too severe ?
Unless involuntary sighs and tender looks are construed into crimes , Lucan has not offended !
- Yet , yet I will break off this - I know not what to call it - improper , at least , as well as painful connection !
- I am almost distracted .
</p>
<p>
I have this moment received a letter from Lord Lucan .
- I am glad of it .
- <page type="Page 16"/> This is encroaching .
- I have now some pretence for my intended breach .
- Yet read it , Fanny .
- I will copy it , if my fast-streaming tears do n't wash the lines away .
</p>
<p>
To Lady BARTON .
</p>
<p>
IF , as I hoped , the most profound submission to her will , whom my mind worships , and my eyes adore , could have preserved me her esteem , never had the unhappy Lucan infringed Lady Barton 's command , nor even dared to repine at being forbidden to express his hopeless passion , by speech or letter to her .
</p>
<p>
But , alas !
Madam , though love is blind , lovers are quick sighted ; and I but too clearly perceive , that I have lost that <page type="Page 17"/> portion of your regard , with which I had , perhaps , too vainly flattered myself .
</p>
<p>
I mean not , Madam , to reproach you with this cruel change , but humbly to implore you to inform me , if I have - tho ' unwittingly , heaven knows !
- been so unfortunate as to have offended you , even in the slightest article of my conduct .
</p>
<p>
If my appearing before you , at this time , without permission , be imputed to me , give me leave to transfer the blame upon chance , which led me hither , without knowing that you had intended to have honoured Lady Creswel 's wedding with your presence .
The transports I was sensible of , on meeting you so unexpectedly here , can not surely be <page type="Page 18"/> deemed a crime ; and yet the misery I have since sustained , has made me already sufficiently atone for it , as if it had been one .
</p>
<p>
Even my present presumption bears its own apology along with it , as your cruelty and my justification required it .
The unhappy , but unoffending suppliant , may expostulate even with Heaven itself , without impiety .
</p>
<p>
I shall trespass no farther on you , Madam , than just to assure you , that I find I belong no longer to myself , and that , in spite both of you and me ,
</p>
<p>
I am , and shall remain , ever yours , LUCAN .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 19"/> What shall I say to him , my sister ?
What answer shall I make to lines so full of tenderness and submission ?
Can I be unjust enough to reproach or condemn him , while he is guiltless of any offence towards me ?
Yet , if I acquit him , do I not criminate myself ?
Must he not think me unworthy of his regards , if female caprice alone should appear the motive of my altered conduct ?
- I will not enter on the subject , but coldly tell him , that I first repented , then conquered my past weakness , and bid him try to follow my example .
- O , Fanny !
I shall break his gentle heart !
If but my own would burst , I should be happy !
</p>
<p>
How inconsistent is this letter with my last !
- Why can I not again recover that <page type="Page 20"/> calmness , which even a transient devotion had inspired ?
- Alas !
because my piety was but temporary , and transitory !
- Like the ungrateful Israelites , I sought the Lord in my trouble .
- But has he not promised to be nigh to all those who call upon him ?
- His mercy is not limited , and in that hope will I confide .
</p>
<p>
More than half the night is elapsed ; but I will not close my eyes till I have written to Lord Lucan .
- Should I defer it till to-morrow , his supplicating eye and te [ ... ] der looks may change my unfirm purpose .
- Would to heaven I had not come here !
- Never was any creature so altered in the time .
- Sir William will certainly perceive the change ; and how shall I account for it ?
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 21"/> It is done , my sister !
I have taken an everlasting leave of Lord Lucan !
- I will copy what I have written - How infinitely short does it fall of what I wished to say !
</p>
<p>
To Lord LUCAN .
</p>
<p>
My Lord ,
</p>
<p>
PERFECTLY sensible , as I am , of the faultiness of my conduct , both towards you and myself , I submit , without repining , to the censure implied in your letter - But , alas !
my Lord , the crime I am there charged with , is not the source of my self-condemnation .
- That you may be perfectly convinced of my sincerity , I will confess that I saw your growing passion , from its earliest infancy , and , at the same time , beheld you in the most favourable light ; - yet I vainly <page type="Page 22"/> hoped , that , situated as I then was , my virtue would have been proof , even against your merit , and my sense of it ; - and that the knowing my heart ought to be devoted to another , was sufficient to render it so .
- How have I since blushed at that presumption , which was founded , not in strength , but weakness .
</p>
<p>
From the moment that the accidental circumstance of the picture , at Southfield , had brought on a confession of our mutual sentiments , peace has been a stranger to my breast !
a consciousness of the irrevocable injury I had been guilty of , towards a person I dare not even name , at present , has haunted me ever since .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 23"/> The constant perturbation of my mind , with other mortifications arising from the same source , brought on a dangerous illness , which led me a willing victim almost to the grave .
I now rejoice that what I then most ardently desired , was not the consequence of the joint disorder , both of heart , and mind , and body .
</p>
<p>
Yes , my Lord , I wish to live , that my future conduct may atone for my past folly ; and that the example of the weakest of the weaker sex , may enable you to conquer a passion , which , if indulged , must be productive of misery only , both to yourself , and its unhappy object .
</p>
<p>
I will not boast , my Lord , that I have already accomplished this arduous task .
<page type="Page 24"/> - My nature is sincere ; - but , as a proof , that I mean seriously to succeed in the attempt , I , from this moment , interdict myself from ever corresponding or conversing with your Lordship more ; and do here declare , that I will never pardon your attempting either to see , or write to me , on any future occasion of our lives .
</p>
<p>
I shall ever retain the sincerest wishes for your Lordship 's happiness , though this is the last time that I shall ever subscribe myself ,
</p>
<p>
Your affectionate friend , L. B .
</p>
<p>
I will not comment on this hateful letter : surely I never wrote so bad a one !
- But is that wonderful ?
- Is not <page type="Page 25"/> the heart , our best inspirer ?
- And can I say that mine dictated this severe decree ?
- Yet I trust my dear Fanny will approve it .
- It has afforded my mind too a temporary relief .
</p>
<p>
I mean to order my coach as soon as I rise in the morning , to send this letter to Lord Lucan , before I appear at breakfast , and set out directly after for Southfield , without giving him time to recover enough from his surprize , so as to attempt an expostulation .
</p>
<p>
I am tempted to leave Harriet with Lady Creswel , that I may perform the journey alone .
- What a journey will it be !
-
</p>
<p>
Adieu , adieu .
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 26"/> INDEED , my ever dear Louisa , your letters have been a heavy alloy to the happiness that I ought now to partake of ; - but , like Joseph , when surrounded with all the magnificence and delights of the Egyptian court , I weep upon the neck of my Benjamin - Yet let me flatter myself , that good , and not ill fate awaits my sister ; as I may now believe the conflict 's past , and that her own reason and virtue have triumphed over a weakness , which , as she justly observes , could only be productive of misery - Of misery , perhaps , in the extreme .
- Yes , my sister , I do most truly applaud both your letter , and your conduct towards <page type="Page 27"/> Lord Lucan ; and , what is of infinitely more consequence , you will yourself approve it .
- You will again enjoy ' `` That peace , which goodness bosoms ever . '' '
- And even feel an higher degree of exultation in your mind , at having recovered the lost path , than those who have never strayed , can possibly be sensible of .
</p>
<p>
With this prophecy I will close the subject of your late letters , and shall be impatient till I find it verified by the calm chearfulness which will , I hope , diffuse itself through all your future correspondence .
</p>
<p>
I have much to tell you , both of myself and our dear brother .
- We have had a wedding , as well as you , but 't was <page type="Page 28"/> a very private one : - Yet surely I may say with Fitzosborne ,
</p>
<p>
'' What tho ' in silence sacred Hymen trod , '' Nor lyre proclaim'd , nor garland crown'd the God : '' What tho ' nor feast , nor revel dance was there , '' ( Vain pomp of joy , the happy well may spare ! ) ''
Yet love unfeign'd , and conscious honour led '' The spotless virgin to the bridal bed . ''
All Heav ` n , and every friendly pow ` r , '' Approv'd the vow , and bless'd the hour . '
But , to proceed regularly - In my last I told you that we should quit St. Omer 's in a few days .
- Do not be shocked , Louisa , when I tell you that we were all very near remaining there for ever !

<p>
As Delia recovered her health , Sir George 's spirits returned ; and , after passing a very chearful evening , this day three weeks , we retired rather before midnight to our chambers .
- I want <page type="Page 29"/> words to express the terror I felt , when I was awaked , about four o ' clock in the morning , by people screaming out fire , and beating at my door , in order to force it open .
- I found myself involved in so thick a smoke , that I could not find the passage out of my chamber , and concluded that I must inevitably perish .
</p>
<p>
Amidst the variety of voices that repeatedly called upon me to pull up the bolt , I thought I distinguished Lord Hume 's - Perhaps this circumstance added to my confusion .
- On a sudden the voice ceased , and I found myself , as it were , left alone in the midst of the flames , which then burst into one side of the room .
</p>
<p>
At that moment a ladder was fixed against one of my windows , and Lord <page type="Page 30"/> Hume entering by it , caught me in his arms , and carried me I know not how , but totally devoid of sense , to his apartment on the other side of the street .
</p>
<p>
When I had recovered my reason , I had the happiness of finding my brother and Delia sitting by me , and my champion kneeling before me , and pouring lavender water on my hands and face , with a look of such tender solicitude , as if his life depended upon mine .
</p>
<p>
The emotion of my gratitude , or call it what you please , was too strong for my spirits - I fainted a second time .
- I was put to bed in this situation , and a surgeon had opened a vein in my arm , before I opened my eyes again .
</p>
<p>
Never can I forget the expressive look of sorrow which appeared in Lord <page type="Page 31"/> Hume 's countenance !
- I confess it , Louisa , it in one moment obliterated all his past offences , and he became even dearer to my heart than he had ever been before .
- His saving my life , even at the hazard of his own , was only a proof of his spirit and humanity , which he ought to have exerted for any other woman , in the same dreadful situation : - But the tender anxiety he shewed towards me afterwards , spoke the fond lover ; and the delicacy of his behaviour from that event , has strengthened his claim to that title .
</p>
<p>
As soon as my arm was bound up , I tried to express my gratitude to Lord Hume , but could not - Tears stopped my utterance , but relieved the oppression of my heart .
- He seemed as little able himself to speak as I , but , in an incoherent <page type="Page 32"/> manner , said , he was the happiest man alive , and kissed my hand in transport .
- Sir George then made every person withdraw , except my maid , and left me for some hours to compose myself .
</p>
<p>
I found , upon enquiry , that the fire which had consumed three houses , began at a sugar baker 's , who lived next door to us , and that it was not discovered till a part of our house was in flames .
- An old servant of Lord Hume 's was the first person who saw the blaze ; - The poor man happened not to be well , and could not sleep : - To his sickness , under Providence , are we indebted for our lives , and he shall never more feel the fatigue of servitude or labour , his lord and my brother having rendered him independent for life .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 33"/> This accident , you may suppose , retarded our setting out .
- Delia , who suffered less than I from the fright , was an equal loser by the fire .
- In short , neither we nor our servants had been able to save any of our cloaths from the flames .
- You may conclude , that the dear good Walter supplied us with every necessary till we could get them made .
</p>
<p>
I fear the apprehension she felt on our account , before she knew that we were safe , has hurt her much .
- She looked so very delicate when we parted , that I scarce dare flatter myself with the hopes of ever seeing her more .
</p>
<p>
While we were delayed at St. Omer 's , a second courier arrived from Mrs. Colville , with a letter to St. George , acknowledging <page type="Page 34"/> her passion for him , pleading that in her excuse , and imploring him in the most abject terms , not to expose her weakness , by carrying on the suit against her ; and assuring him of her full consent to his marriage with her daughter .
</p>
<p>
In order to avoid being brought to England by the chancellor 's messenger , she has retired privately from Toulouse , and has placed herself in a convent , but where we know not , nor shall ever enquire .
- I hope she will remain , wherever she is , for life , as I really believe , that the bare sight of her would shock our poor Delia more than the fire had done .
</p>
<p>
She has sent back the small trunk which belonged to the person who died <page type="Page 35"/> at Amiens , and has desired that Sir George may open it , in order to forward the papers in it , to the party for whom they are designed ; if this can be discovered from the initials , which is the only address they have .
- My brother has assigned this commission to me , and as soon as I have a moment 's leisure , I will execute it faithfully .
</p>
<p>
If I continue to write so circumstantially , there will be no end of this letter ; you must therefore take leave of St. Omer 's , and suffer yourself to be instantly transported across the water with me , as if you were reading one of Shakespeare 's plays , and conclude us now safely arrived in London , whence I am now writing to you .
</p>
<p>
After my brother had waited on the chancellor , and shewn him Mrs. Colville 's <page type="Page 36"/> letters , he most readily gave his consent to Delia 's marriage , and said if he were a bachelor , he should be very proud of such an help-mate , as the fair lady , - meaning me , Louisa , - who had acted with so much prudence in the conduct of this extraordinary affair .
</p>
<p>
As both the parties were very well inclined to enter into the holy state of matrimony , they readily dispensed with the parade of a public wedding ; and on Saturday last , my brother had the happiness of receiving his well-beloved wife , from the hands of my beloved husband , that is to be - For we shall take more state and form upon us than they have done , I assure you .
</p>
<p>
Joy to my Louisa !
- The happy pair set out next day for Cleveland-hall , whither <page type="Page 37"/> I shall follow them in a very few days .
- Mary Granville and Lord Hume are to accompany me ; and the moment I know my Louisa 's heart is at peace , I shall give Lord Hume a legal claim to mine , but not till then ; for indeed , my sister , I can not taste of joy , while you are wretched !
</p>
<p>
Lord Hume and my brother have complained much of the dejection of my spirits since we came from France ; - I have attributed the change in me to that of the climate ; but I think they do n't acquiesce in that opinion , and suspect a hidden cause of sorrow , though they know not from whence it can arise - O , be happy , my Louisa !
and make me so !
</p>
<p>
Lord Hume 's chariot stops at the door - A lawyer with him - How tremendous !
<page type="Page 38"/> and not a creature with me !
- Run , Robert , for Miss Granville - Horrid parchments !
- Shocking deeds !
- My hand trembles - I can never sign them - How did you !
</p>
<p>
Adieu , adieu , my sister !
</p>
<p>
F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
London .
</p>
<p>
IF you are not absolutely dwindled into a state of vegetation , and fixed like a plant to one peculiar spot , I conjure you , by all the powers of friendship , my dear Lucan , to set out on the receipt of this , to be witness to that happiness , which I confess beyond either my expectation <page type="Page 39"/> or deserts , and which I can hardly believe to be real .
</p>
<p>
Listen - Fanny Cleveland 's lovely hand , - what a contrast to her cheek !
then blushing like the rosy morn , has signed our marriage articles , and I now only wait for that short passport to happiness , which is contained in a few mystical words , that , I suppose , are to hold us inchanted for the rest of our lives .
</p>
<p>
For my own part , I acknowledge the spell already .
- Could all the arguments of philosophy ever have convinced me , without my own experience , that the slightest touch of Cleveland 's hand , should communicate a richer transport to my soul , than the closest embrace of Margarita .
- In one case I feel myself a man , in the other , but a brute .
In the first instance , I <page type="Page 40"/> am sensible of the union of mind and body ; in the second , my sensations were totally devoid of all sentiment whatever .
- Is not this charming enthusiasm ?
- I mistook my transports , before - Took giddiness for frolic , extravagance for spirit , folly for fondness , and appetite for passion .
</p>
<p>
On my honour , Lucan !
my Fanny is ten thousand times more lovely than when I left England .
- In short , I did not know her then , or I could never have been so infatuated as I was , to a creature so every way her inferior - But come , my friend , come , I again intreat you , and see this earthly paragon .
</p>
<p>
You say you are at an immense distance from the object of your affection - What signifies then a thousand miles , more or <page type="Page 41"/> less , since you are deprived of the pleasure of seeing her ?
- I begin to think she must be some unnatural , manufactured prude .
- Do n't be angry , Lucan , I have no reason to abuse her , but on your account , - Not even to permit your writing to her !
- Perhaps your quitting the kingdom where she is , may bring her to better temper .
- I am but a bad judge in these romantic matters , though I am certain that no man living is at this moment more sincerely in love than I am .
</p>
<p>
Sir George Cleveland was married last week , and I had the honour of giving the bride away .
- She is a charming girl , I confess , but nothing to be compared to my Cleveland .
- But they have beauty enough between them to stock a seraglio .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 42"/> I do most sincerely wish to have you at my wedding , Lucan ; but I shall not wait an hour for your coming ; nor should I think of your being present at the ceremony , but that my Fanny has declared she will not bestow her hand , without the concurrence of a sister who lives in Ireland , a Lady Barton .
- Do you know her , Lucan ?
she was a charming girl before she married , though not quite as handsome as my Fanny .
</p>
<p>
You see then you have no time to lose ; for I must not suppose that her Ladyship , however matronly she may have become since her marriage , can possibly object now to a connection which she seemed once to encourage and approve .
Give the reins to your horses , and away , my friend , to
</p>
<p>
yours , most truly , HUME .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 44"/> P.S. .
If you should not find me in London , post off to Cleveland-hall .
- I long to introduce you to Sir George and his lady , but more particularly to my dear Fanny .
</p>
<p>
DO not , I conjure you , my dear Louisa , add to my misery , by delaying your own happiness - The first has already reached its zenith , - O may the latter do so too !
</p>
<p>
I will not enter into any further explanation , nor mention a single particular relative to myself , till I know that you are married .
If , therefore , you are anxious about the most interesting events <page type="Page 43"/> of my life , I shall shortly receive a letter , from Lady Hume , which will then entitle her to a confidence now with-held from my beloved Fanny Cleveland , by her
</p>
<p>
ever affectionate sister , LOUISA BARTON .
</p>
<p>
I HAVE hesitated , for some time , dear Louisa , whether , in your present dejected state of mind , I should venture to communicate to you a story of much woe , which was contained in the papers of the unhappy young woman who died at Amiens .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 45"/> The diverting of any current must necessarily abate its force , and whatever can awaken our sensibility for the misfortunes of others , must , at least for the time , render us insensible to our own .
</p>
<p>
I believe too , that comparison weighs much in our estimation of good and evil ; and though a generous heart , even labouring under the severest calamities , may be incapable of forming a wish for relief , at the expence of another 's happiness , yet I am persuaded , that there is a sort of alleviation to be found , in reflecting that there are , or rather , that there have been , others much more wretched than ourselves .
</p>
<p>
Upon this principle then I shall send you this melancholy story , which I should never have been mistress of , had <page type="Page 46"/> the papers in which it was contained , though unsealed , been properly addressed ; but as they were only superscribed with initials , I was obliged to look into the contents , in order to forward them to the person for whom they were designed ; and I hope my taking a copy of them , for you , and you only , will not be considered as a breach of trust , either to the living , or the dead .
</p>
<p>
As soon as my brother and sister went out of town , which was the first moment I had leisure , I opened the little trunk which Mrs. Colville 's last messenger brought to St. Omer 's , and which may properly enough be called the lachrymal urn , of the unfortunate Maria ; for in it was the tearful narrative of a life of sorrows , deposited ; and though she is now <page type="Page 47"/> removed from a possibility of feeling them , they still retain the magnetic power of living grief , and must attract the sigh of pity from every tender , every feeling heart .
</p>
<p>
The STORY of MARIA .
</p>
<p>
To Mr. EDWARD S - .
</p>
<p>
Will the most tender and affectionate of brothers , with patience , condescend to read the sad confession of a dying wretch , who owns herself unworthy of his kindness , - Yet , trembling on the verge of life , solicits to obtain his pardon and pity !
- Alas !
my Edward , they will never reach me !
- No friendly voice can ever sooth my ear , or speak peace to my perturbed heart !
for soon the motion of its pulse shall cease , and this poor shattered frame return to dust .
- Drop then <page type="Page 48"/> one fond forgiving tear upon these pages : - 'T is all I now can ask , or you , e'er long , can grant .
</p>
<p>
The story of my misconduct and misfortunes , perhaps , will reach you , before this letter .
- How does my heart now bleed for that indignant grief your generous mind must feel , for a beloved sister 's infamy !
</p>
<p>
I do not mean to extenuate my faults ; - Alas !
they will not bear extenuation !
- And , conscious as I am of my approach to that tribunal , before which we must all e'er long appear , deceit or falshood would be as weak as wicked .
- Then hear the faithful story of my heart , and judge me as one erring mortal should another .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 49"/> In less than a year after you sailed for Bengal , our dear father died - What an irreparable loss was mine !
- I need not tell you that as he was in the church , we were at once deprived of the principal part of his fortune , with his life , and that there did not remain above an hundred pounds a year , being a life annuity , purchased for my mother with her own portion , to support her and me .
</p>
<p>
The altered countenances and behaviour of those we had formerly called friends , at Gloucester , made my mother determine on quitting a place where , from her want of knowing the world , she considered herself as particularly ill treated .
- She was then first taught , that prosperity is the cement of modern friendship ; and when that fails , the tottering structure sinks into decay .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 50"/> She condescended to consult me upon our future scheme of life ; though , as I was not then fifteen , I was but ill qualified for an adviser ; however , I had heard that Bath was a cheap place of residence , for those who settle themselves as inhabitants there ; and as I also believed it to be an agreeable lively scene , I had often wished to go thither , during my father 's life ; and therefore used all my little rhetoric with my mother , to fix us there .
</p>
<p>
I prevailed ; and the first year we spent in it , was by many degrees the happiest of my life .
- We lived in a small house , near the Cross-bath , with the greatest oeconomy .
- My mother did not go much into public , but we met with many former acquaintances , who were so obliging <page type="Page 51"/> to matronize me to the rooms , playhouse , and walks , as often as it was thought proper to let me appear abroad .
</p>
<p>
You can not , my Edward , have forgotten my face and person , and may suppose that I was not without admirers , in the midst of so many gay flutterers as abound at Bath .
- There are , I believe , fewer serious engagements made there , than at any place where such a concourse of young people continually meet .
- Whether this is owing to the perpetual dissipation they live in , or to the constant rotation of new faces that appear there daily , is not to me material .
- My heart , alas !
was but too susceptible of a tender impression ; and Captain L - , son to Sir Richard L - , first inspired my artless bosom with love .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 52"/> During the first three months of our acquaintance , we saw each other every day ; nor did the idea of parting , or any other painful thought , obtrude upon our minds , to interrupt the pleasing delirium of our mutual fondness .
</p>
<p>
Our happiness was then most certainly too great to last .
- A letter from Sir Richard L - to his son , acquainting him that he was promoted to the rank of Captain , in a regiment which was then stationed in Ireland , with a peremptory command to set out thither immediately , was the first , and we then thought the severest shock , that fate could inflict on us .
</p>
<p>
Though my mother was extremely indulgent to me , yet , from a delicacy natural to young minds , I had never ventured <page type="Page 53"/> to acquaint her with my attachment to Captain L - .
To this small , but fatal error , I , perhaps , owe most of the subsequent miseries of my life .
</p>
<p>
The most intimate acquaintance I then had , was a young married lady , about three and twenty , who seemed to have the greatest friendship for my lover , and tenderness for me , imaginable - Her name is - , but I will not expose her , for the sake of a respectable family to whom she is allied - though she has brought infamy and sorrows upon me and mine .
</p>
<p>
I will call her Matilda - To her then I disclosed the anguish of my heart , at the sad thought of parting with my lover , and wept upon her bosom - She seemed <page type="Page 54"/> to consider my distress as trifling : - Told me I had too much sensibility to be happy , and advised me to conquer it ; - then added , laughing , these first passions are always troublesome , but you will not be so much affected at parting with your next lover .
I was offended and disgusted at her speech - The very idea had profligacy in it - She quickly perceived my resentment , and had address enough to change her stile , and soothe me into the most perfect confidence .
</p>
<p>
During the short time that Captain L - remained at Bath , after his father 's summons , we three were inseparable .
- He would have married me , at that interval ; but , as he was not of age , being then but just turned of twenty , he could get no clergyman to perform the ceremony <page type="Page 55"/> for us .
- At length the fatal hour of separation arrived - Happiness and he were one , in my estimation - They fled , alas !
together .
</p>
<p>
From his letters I received the sole consolation that could alleviate the pangs of absence .
- They were frequent and tender ; yet I thought latterly , that I sometimes discovered a little tendency towards jealousy in them ; but , unconscious as I was of having given the slightest ground for suspicion , by my conduct , I thought it beneath me to enter into a particular defence against a general charge ; and therefore suffered every hint upon this subject to pass unnoticed .
</p>
<p>
We had lived now above a year at Bath , and my mother began to find herself <page type="Page 56"/> extremely straitened in her circumstances - You had it not then in your power , my dear and generous Edward , to relieve her distress ; and I am certain that one of the severest , which she herself felt , was her not being able to assist you , in the first dawnings of your then infant fortunes .
</p>
<p>
My mother , though past the prime of life , was still handsome ; and , at such a crisis , dress is of much more consequence to a woman , than at an earlier aera ; she had been used to elegance and affluence , yet she chearfully resigned them all , and continued to wear deep mourning , in order to ornament me with the remains of her former paraphernalia , and every little addition that she could make to it .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 57"/> Matilda used to take me with her frequently to the rooms , and generally invited me to private parties , at her own apartments ; - sometimes with my mother , but oftener without .
- She always played high , and seemed solicitous to possess me with the same passion .
- I resisted the temptation , for some time , on account of the danger and indecorum of such a course of life .
- To which she replied , that as cards were now become the bon ton of all civilized nations , the latter of my objections was sufficiently obviated ; and that , in order to guard against the former , the earlier I began to practise , the better .
- For , as I should soon be a person of rank and fortune , by the death of Sir Richard L - , I could not think of living like a housewife , in such an improved and enlightened <page type="Page 58"/> age , as the present ; and that , as high play had now became the general amusement and occupation of all people intitled to associate in polite life , the sooner I was initiated into the arts and sciences of gaming , the safer it would be for my husband 's fortune , or my own .
</p>
<p>
She would sometimes make me hold her cards , while she sat by , and instructed me how to play them ; then she would make me join in the stake , and at last led me in to adventure for myself , on her promise to lend me what money I might lose , till I should be in a condition of repaying her .
</p>
<p>
I am convinced that there is but one step easy to avoid , in vice , and that is the first .
- The fear and disgust with which I <page type="Page 59"/> had engaged at play , at the beginning , wore off by degrees ; and habit had seduced my mind into such a passion for cards , in a short time , that I regretted the Sundays that my mother confined me at home , after the church service was over , to read proper discourses , and listen to her most excellent instructions .
</p>
<p>
Mr. W - , an elderly gentleman of fortune , used generally to be of our parties .
- He seemed to distinguish me , in a particular manner , and used to favour me at play ; which , as soon as I discovered , I immediately resented , and declared I would lay down my cards , if he should ever again attempt to pay me the least compliment of the kind , to the disadvantage , either of himself , or any of the rest of the company .
- This proper <page type="Page 60"/> reproof of mine obliged him to restrain his too indelicate galantry towards me for the future .
</p>
<p>
My card-accompt preserved itself pretty even for some time , without giving me occasion to trespass on the credit which my friend Matilda had made me so voluntary a proffer of ; till one night that I happened to be led in by her , to engage at loo , which was a game I had never played at before , and knew so little of , as not to be aware how deeply I might be involved , upon a turn of luck against me .
- The stakes were not high , but , as the sorfeits were unlimited , I found myself indebted to Mr. W - , in the sum of thirty guineas , when the party broke up .
</p>
<p>
I applied to my friend for the money , but she put me off at that time , by saying <page type="Page 61"/> that I should try my fortune again , the next evening , at her apartments ; and that she would then put whatever ballance should appear against me on a proper footing for payment .
- I was tempted to venture on a second essay at the same game , and concluded the night with doubling the debt to the same person .
I then claimed Matilda 's promise ; but she answered me with great coldness , and a constrained smile , that my creditor was a gentleman of large fortune , and , as he had made her a confidant of his partiality in my favour , she should think it a breach of honour to take me out of his hands , by releasing me from so trifling an obligation as this was .
</p>
<p>
The surprise and alarm I felt upon this occasion is not to be expressed - It was <page type="Page 62"/> too surely a presage of all my future miseries !
- I began to find that I had been most treacherously dealt by - I retired to my chamber , without speaking even to my mother , and passed the night in walking about distractedly , and crying out , How shall I be ever able to discharge this dangerous debt !
or how render a justifiable account of my conduct , either to my mother , to the world , but more especially to my dear Captain L - !
</p>
<p>
I confined myself at home for several days after this adventure , during which time Matilda came often to solicit my returning into the world again , and affected to ridicule my prudery , in being rendered so uneasy about so insignificant a circumstance , which , she assured me was <page type="Page 63"/> but one of the common events of life .
However , I continued resolute in keeping myself retired , and remained inconsolable , on this unhappy incident , till I received a letter from Captain L - , which I opened with transport , hoping it would calm my mind , and restore my peace again .
- Alas !
what an aggravation to my misfortune and distress , did I meet with there !
</p>
<p>
He told me that his regiment was ordered to America , and that he should embark with it in less than ten days , which time was elapsed at the moment I received his letter .
- He added , that my conduct had convinced him , that , if he should never return to England , I would be easily consoled for his loss , though he should never cease to regret mine - Wished <page type="Page 64"/> me every happiness that a life of dissipation could yield , and bad me farewell - For ever !
</p>
<p>
My mind already disturbed and agitated , this cruel letter almost unhinged my reason , and sunk me into the most pitiable state of dejection .
- My mother , who was ignorant of the real cause of my disturbance , apprehended some heavy disorder to be falling upon me , and attended me night and day , with the fondest anxiety imaginable .
</p>
<p>
For some time I continued in a state of the profoundest melancholy ; - at length the voice of nature waked my reason .
- The tears and sighs of a fond parent , by sympathetic force attracted mine , and called forth all my gratitude - I strove to <page type="Page 65"/> hide my anguish , even in smiles , but it still preyed upon my tortured heart .
</p>
<p>
The shame of having carried on a clandestine correspondence , with a lover , who had now so plainly cast me off , prevented my revealing to my mother any circumstance of a connection , which I then considered as disgraceful to me .
- But I flew directly to Matilda , who had been my only confidant in this secret , and communicated the letter to her .
- She received me coldly , as she had done before , on my former difficulty - told me that this too was but another of the common events of life - That the most constant lovers were not to be considered more than perennials ; but that Bath passions never lasted , beyond the season - that <page type="Page 66"/> they were inspired by the heat of the waters , and cooled as they did .
</p>
<p>
What makes girls so woe-begone , said she , upon such disappointments , is the overweaning conceit they are too apt to frame of their own consequence ; but they must abate considerably of their romantic self-sufficience , before they will find themselves in the station where nature has designed them .
- A toy , a rattle , which ten will play with , for one who will think of becoming a serious purchaser .
</p>
<p>
Such maxims as these , whether true or false , were not likely to assuage my grief , and I returned home the most unhappy creature breathing .
- I accused Captain L - of falsehood , of perjury , <page type="Page 67"/> a thousand times , alas !
in vain , did I vow to cast him from my heart and memory for ever .
- Pardon , thou dear departed shade , these and all other injuries I have unwittingly been the sad occasion of to you !
</p>
<p>
During my confinement , Mr. W - made the most constant and obliging inquiries about me , and in the most friendly manner offered my mother a house he had near the Hot-wells at Bristol , with the use of his carriage , servants , &c. - As I continued in a very low and languid state , even after my recovery , change of air was judged necessary for me , particularly as the physician who attended me , apprehended my falling into a consumption .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 68"/> I had however , a very strong objection to accepting Mr. W - 's obliging offer , from an unwillingness to receiving farther favours from one , to whom I was already too much indebted .
</p>
<p>
But this difficulty was a good deal obviated , by his declaring that he was engaged on a party , for two months , to visit Paris ; and during that time , both his house and carriage must be entirely useless to him .
</p>
<p>
At my mother 's intreaty , and not opposed by me , Matilda consented to accompany us ; and I own I felt a gleam of joy , at removing from a place , where every object reminded me of my unhappiness : I did not then reflect that I could not fly from myself , and that neither happiness or misery are local .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 69"/> Mr. W - accompanied us to Bristol , and put us into possession of a very elegant house , in which he left four servants to attend us , at board wages - There was an ample supply of tea , wine , sweet-meats , and every elegance , which he insisted on our using , as if they were our own , and took his leave , in the politest manner , earnestly requesting that he might find us there at his return .
</p>
<p>
The waters and the change of scene certainly conduced to the recovery of my health ; but peace and chearfulness were both estranged from my sad bosom , and the only moments I enjoyed , were those in which I could prevail on Matilda to listen to my griefs .
- I soon discovered that she grew weary of the painful office ; she was totally immersed in gaiety , and <page type="Page 70"/> used oftener to rally , than soothe my affliction .
</p>
<p>
Under all the disadvantages , which the gloomy veil of sorrow had cast arround me , a Yorkshire baronet , Sir James D - , saw , and liked me ; he immediately addressed himself to my mother , and was by her most favourably received .
She was overjoyed at the prospect , of what she called my happiness , and spoke to me of Sir James 's proposal with transport .
</p>
<p>
This was the second outrage , if I may so call it , that my heart had suffered - I fell into an agony of grief , and before I could recollect myself , or she prevent me , I vowed to heaven , in the most solemn manner , that I would never be Sir James 's wife .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 71"/> Even at this moment , Edward , I behold the figure of my astonished , my offended mother !
She had however , so much reason at command , as not to urge my madness farther , but quitted the room , with a look of indignation , mingled with surprise and sorrow .
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes I followed her into her chamber , and found her in tears ; I could not bear them , Edward !
I fell upon my knees before her , implored her pardon , and offered even to sacrifice myself by marrying Sir James D - , rather than render her wretched .
</p>
<p>
She answered with the utmost calmness , I fear , Maria , it is out of your power to prevent my being so ; you are unhappy , my child , and I must suffer <page type="Page 72"/> with you - I hoped - but it is over - For be assured that after the vow you have so rashly made , no power on earth should force me to consent to my child 's perjury .
Sir James shall have his answer .
</p>
<p>
But let me now inform you of a secret I wished to have concealed for ever from you - Penury and want surround us , and we shall soon be given up a prey to them - We must return to Bath , no more .
I will mortgage our little income , to pay our debts ; in some obscure corner we must labour for our bread , help to support ourselves in honest indigence , and strive to humble our minds to our conditions .
</p>
<p>
I do not condemn you , my child - Affections are not to be forced - I flattered <page type="Page 73"/> myself that your youth and beauty might have obtained an advantageous match , which would have been a support to me , and an establishment to yourself .
Sir James D - 's proposal was beyond my hopes , but I do not wish to render you a victim for my sake ; nor shall this subject ever be mentioned more between us .
</p>
<p>
O , my brother !
think what I suffered while my mother spoke - I would at that moment have died a thousand deaths to have made her happy ; yet even then I inwardly rejoiced at being relieved from my apprehensions of marrying a man I could not love .
</p>
<p>
You may suppose I uttered all that gratitude could dictate , for my mother 's kindness , and promised , for my future <page type="Page 74"/> life , to know no will but hers - Talked of contented poverty ; preferred an humble lot with peace of mind , to splendid misery ; and strove in vain to combat with her sorrows .
</p>
<p>
On this occasion , I not only assumed , but felt a degree of chearfulness , to which my heart had long been a stranger .
I triumphed over Captain L - 's unjust suspicions ; in the midst of poverty , I rejected an advantageous settlement , and despised a title which must be bought at the expence of love .
</p>
<p>
I expected Matilda would have applauded my heroism , but was disappointed - She disapproved my conduct , called me romantic and absurd , condemned my mother 's want of spirit , and said that <page type="Page 75"/> had she been in her place she would have compelled me to marry Sir James D - , and made me happy in spite of my own folly .
-
</p>
<p>
In about four days after this event , Mr W - , whom we had imagined to be in France , returned to Bristol - As I was sensible of the highest gratitude towards him , I confess I felt a degree of pleasure at his arrival , and received him with all the marks of regard due to a friend .
</p>
<p>
There was a vacant apartment in the house , which he asked my mother 's leave to occupy - she certainly had not a right to refuse , yet I could perceive that she was vastly embarrassed by the request .
- The next morning she told me that she <page type="Page 76"/> was determined to quit Bristol , immediately , though she knew not where to bend her course , as she did not think it proper to remain longer in Mr. W - 's house .
</p>
<p>
As this person was near fifty years of age , I had never considered him in any other light than as a father ; however , the impropriety of living under his roof , any longer , struck me as soon as it was mentioned - I told her I was ready to attend her , when and wherever she pleased .
- She burst into tears , and said , ' `` Alas , my child , who will receive the friendless widow , and her helpless orphan ! '' '
</p>
<p>
At that instant Mr. W - , who had overheard our discourse , came into the <page type="Page 77"/> room , and taking my mother 's hand , said , ' `` Behold in me , Madam , a protector , and a son , who will think himself happy in making you so . '' '
</p>
<p>
The first emotion of my heart , at this declaration , was gratitude - Modesty alone restrained me from embracing Mr. W - ; I cried out , in an extasy , ' `` O Sir !
you are too good , too generous !
how shall we ever be able to make you an amends ? '' '
</p>
<p>
He instantly replied , ' `` It is in your power , Madam , to overpay all my services ; I ask no more than that fair hand can give ; but then your heart , as well as person must be mine ; without the first , the latter would be worthless - I will not at this moment expect your answer , you are fully apprised of your <page type="Page 78"/> mother 's sentiments and situation , and you alone can tell whether you chuse or not to dry her tears . '' '
</p>
<p>
He quitted the room directly , but he might have remained there , and talked for an hour , without hazarding any interruption from me ; I was absolutely petrified with horror and surprise - Before I could recover myself , my mother , with her eyes still streaming , threw herself on her knees before me , and pressing my hand to her heart , said , ' `` I do not ask you , my beloved child , to sacrifice yourself for me - but , O consider , my Maria !
to what insults and misfortunes your innocence and youth must be exposed , when you shall lose even the poor support you have in me - I know I can not long endure distress , <page type="Page 79"/> my death must leave you a prey to every ill , to every danger .
You will then reflect , with grief and shame , on that false delicacy that actuates you now , and vainly lament the loss of a fond parent , whom you have suffered to sink with sorrow to the grave . '' '
</p>
<p>
I could bear no more - I fell on my knees before her , I clasped her in my arms , and bathed her bosom with my flowing tears , while I cried out , ' `` O take me , sacrifice me , do what you will with me , I will not be a parricide !
But give me time to conquer this poor heart , and tear my L - 's much loved image from my breast . '' '
</p>
<p>
At the name of L - my mother started up , and raised me with her ; then <page type="Page 80"/> looking at me with unutterable anguish , said it must not be , if your heart feels a passion for another object , I will much sooner die than make you wretched .
- But who is Mr. L - , and how has he deserved Maria 's love ?
- Shame kept me silent ; but when my mother repeated her question , I replied , do not press me farther , Madam ; Matilda can inform you both of my weakness and misfortune .
</p>
<p>
As I wished to retire upon the instant , I opened a door that led by a few steps into the garden , - In my confusion I missed my footing , and fell from the top to the bottom .
- My mother flew to my assistance , but could not raise me ; she called for help , and when Matilda and Mr. W - , who were in the garden , lifted me from the ground , I could not <page type="Page 81"/> stand .
- I was carried into the house , and a surgeon sent for , who acquainted them that I had dislocated my right ancle .
</p>
<p>
In the midst of the pain I suffered , even during the action of setting my ancle , I secretly rejoiced in this accident , as it must , at least for some days , retard an event to me more horrible than death .
- My heart was overflowing still with fondness for the faithless L - , and I was sensible of too much respect for Mr. W - , to love him .
</p>
<p>
The second day of my confinement , my mother told me that Matilda had informed her of every particular relative to the attachment between Captain L - and me ; that tho ' she considered it as a childish and romantic affair on my side , <page type="Page 82"/> and a mere matter of galantry on his ; yet her tenderness for me , had made her consent to Matilda 's writing to him , and acquainting him with every particular of my present situation ; and if , in answer to that letter , he should declare a serious and honourable passion for me , she solemnly promised never to oppose my inclination , but chearfully wait his return , and yield her consent to our union , but if , on the contrary -
</p>
<p>
Stop there , my dearest mother , I exclaimed , you have outgone my wishes ; for if Captain L - should hesitate a moment to receive me as his wife , not only [ ... ] y hand , but my heart shall then be free ; and gratitude to the best of parents shall enable me to bestow them , unreluctantly , on any person whom her prudence shall select .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 83"/> My mother embraced me , and bathed my cheeks with tears of fondness .
At that moment I thought myself the happiest of mortals .
- Matilda joined us , and read the letter she had written to Captain L - .
I did not think that it sufficiently described either my affection or my distress ; but as my mother approved of it , I did not presume to make any objection , but only engaged her promise to add a defence of my conduct , from the misapprehensions or misrepresentatations he seemed to have conceived or received before , with regard to it .
</p>
<p>
You know , my Edward , that my mother was integrity itself ; she could not therefore bear to be guilty of the smallest deceit ; and though Mr. W - had not pressed for any answer to his proposal , <page type="Page 84"/> on account of the accident that had happened to me , she resolved to tell him that there was a friend in America , without whose consent I was determined never to marry ; that this person had been written to , and that he should be informed of his answer , the moment it arrived .
</p>
<p>
Mr. W - received this information with a very ill grace , but acquiesced so far as to say , that he could have no doubt of this unheard of guardian 's consent to such an offer as his ; and as an answer might arrive before I was perfectly restored to my health , there was no great harm in asking it ; but he did not suppose that we should be weak enough to refuse his alliance , even though this particular friend might not approve of it .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 85"/> My mother , though extremely disgusted at the roughness of his reply , concealed the coarseness of his expression from me , and I considered myself extremely obliged to him for not persecuting me any further , for the present , with his ungracious and unwelcome passion .
</p>
<p>
Matilda was obliged to return to her house at Bath ; and as my mother spent most of her time in my chamber , and that Mr. W - was not permitted to make long visits to me , on pretence of the necessity of my being kept quiet , he grew weary of passing his domestic hours alone , and to my very great joy , set out for London .
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 86"/> I have written so long , my dear Louisa , that I am scarce able to hold the pen , but I could not possibly stop in this interesting narrative , such I hope you will think it , till I came to what may properly be called a resting place - For though we do not leave Maria happy , her hopes and fears are held in equipoise , and this perhaps may not be one of the least eligible situations in human life .
</p>
<p>
Since I wrote to you I have had a letter from Mrs. Walter , my apprehensions for her life are increased by it ; they more than preponderate against my hopes , my spirits sink with them - But I am in a gloomy mood , at present ; I will try to shake it off ; Lord Hume will assist me , I hear him coming up stairs - Till to-morrow , farewell , my loved Louisa .
</p>
<p>
F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 87"/> I Shall proceed in my task of copying , like a clerk in an office , without attending to any thing but the draft before me , and indeed , my Louisa , I find it sufficiently interesting to engross all my attention .
- If it can exclude those pleasing sentiments which my present happiness ought , and does inspire , may I not reasonably hope that it will be able to suspend , at least during the time of reading it , that heavy weight which seems to press upon my sisters heart ?
Yes , I am persuaded that it may , and under this belief , I reassume the pen .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 88"/> The STORY of MARIA , continued .
</p>
<p>
In less than a month , I was able to walk , with a little help , and most earnestly wished to quit Mr. W - 's house ; as I had reason to hope from the justification of my character , which Matilda assured me she had undertaken , that there would be an end of all connection between us , the moment I should receive a letter from Captain L - ; and that an interview , on such an occasion , must be painful to us both .
</p>
<p>
I therefore pressed my mother to try to borrow the money she wanted , at Bristol , and return to Bath .
- She complied with my request , and judged it necessary to take up a larger sum , on her annuity , than she at first intended , as either my marriage with Mr. W - , or my waiting Captain L - 's return to England , must be attended with expence .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 89"/> In short , on such terms as the poor borrow , and the rich lend , she obtained two hundred pounds , which I then thought an immense sum ; but did not consider that we owed more than half of it already , including my debt to Mr. W -
</p>
<p>
I am thus circumstantial with you , my dear Edward , that you may be perfectly able to judge of the motives which impelled me to my ruin - O would to heaven , that I alone had been to suffer the so much dreaded ills of poverty !
I would have braved them all ; but a beloved , and tender parent , whose fondness towards me had involved her in distress !
It was not to be born .
</p>
<p>
My mother wrote a very polite letter to Mr. W - , thanking him for all his <page type="Page 90"/> civilities , and acquainting him with our return to Bath , where he joined us in a few days - He brought some very handsome jewels , and other presents , from London , for me , which I absolutely refused , and even felt my delicacy offended at his offering them , as it seemed to hint at a certainty of my becoming his wife .
</p>
<p>
As the time approached when we might expect an answer from Captain L - , I counted the hours , and rejoiced in their flight ; the anxiety of suspence was visible in my looks and words ; I started at every sound , and minutely inquired the business of every person who rapped at the door .
At length the fatal moment arrived that was to change a state of fond hope into the utmost despair .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 91"/> Matilda came to our house one morning , and requested to see my mother alone ; the gloom which sat on her brow , announced the tidings which she brought , and though scarce able to utter a syllable , I cried out , ' `` I will not leave the room , I know the worst already , he is dead ! '' '
She answered coldly , no !
and reached a letter to me - the contents whereof were as follows -
</p>
<p>
To MATILDA .
</p>
<p>
Dear Madam ,
</p>
<p>
Honoured as I am by the favour of your letter , and happy in hearing of your health , will you not think me ungrateful if I repine at your wasting so much of your time and paper , in relating particulars of a person , who now only lives in my memory , from the bare recollection <page type="Page 92"/> of having sometimes seen her with you ?
</p>
<p>
But as all preferences are flattering , I should be unpolite not to thank miss S - , for an offer , which I must however decline .
I heartily wish her happiness with Sir James D - , Mr. W - , or whomsoever else she shall think proper to honour with her fair hand , excepting , Madam , your
</p>
<p>
most obedient servant , T. L .
</p>
<p>
My faculties were all suspended , for several minutes , after reading this insulting letter -
</p>
<p>
'' No sigh to rise , no tear had power to flow . ''
I felt like one that had been stunned by a severe stroke - At length recovering <page type="Page 93"/> myself , I flung the hated paper from me , and taking my mother 's hand , said , with an effort of calmness , ' `` How poor , Madam , is the sacrifice that I can now make to duty - A rejected hand , and heart !
but dispose of them as you please , and do it quickly , while my reason holds . '' '
My mother was more alarmed at my behaviour than she would have been had I fallen into a passion , either of grief or rage - She wept abundantly , for my distress , and expressed every sentiment of parental fondness - her kindness would have transformed me to a Niobe at any other time , but the sorrow that had then taken possession of my heart , was of too powerful a nature to be softened by her tears , or dissipated by my own - 'T was grief unutterable .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 94"/> My mother kindly indulged me , for several days , by allowing me to keep my chamber , on pretence of a sore throat - this prevented my seeing Mr. W - , and gave me time to reflect upon my own situation .
- I considered myself as an offering that was to be sacrificed , and determined to support the rôle that fate had allotted me , with becoming fortitude .
</p>
<p>
Mr. W - expressed the utmost impatience for our marriage , and in about six weeks after the receipt of Captain L - 's letter , I was led to the altar , and became the wretched wife of Mr. W - .
</p>
<p>
In vain did I endeavour to assume an air of chearfulness , with a breaking heart ; unused to deceit or artifice , the veil <page type="Page 95"/> which I put on could not conceal the gloomy tints which sorrow had engraven upon my mind .
I was hourly reproached by my husband with ill-temper and ingratitude , and my mother was accused of having drawn him into a match , so much against his interest , and so little conducive to his happiness .
</p>
<p>
For her dear sake , I exerted my utmost powers to please , but they seldom met with success ; and I , with unspeakable grief , now saw that she was rendered infinitely more wretched by my marriage , than she could have been in any other situation .
</p>
<p>
Mr. W - 's estate was in Devonshire ; he had an old family seat there , where I most earnestly wished to spend <page type="Page 96"/> my days in solitude and peace ; but as he often told me , that he did not think we should make a pleasant tête-a-tête together there , he disposed of his house at Bristol , and hired one at Bath , from which he frequently made excursions to London , or else-where , for a month or six weeks at a time .
</p>
<p>
During his absence , I seldom stirred abroad , unless to church , to pay some visit of ceremony , or to pass an hour , or perhaps an evening , with Matilda .
</p>
<p>
From the moment I was married I had never mentioned the name of Captain L - to my mother , Matilda , or any other person - This was a sacrifice I thought due to my husband ; I would have done more , had it been in my <page type="Page 97"/> power , and banished him for ever from my thoughts .
</p>
<p>
One evening , while Mr. W - was away , I was prevailed upon , by Matilda and my mother , to go to the Rooms , on a ball-night - I found my spirits strongly affected with a scene that reminded me of happier days ; and became so much absorbed in my own reflections , that I scarce heard the sound of the music , or observed the motion of the dancers , though Matilda was among then .
</p>
<p>
I was sitting on one of the benches , opposite the door of the room , and had continued a considerable time in my reverie , when my eyes were accidentally caught by the figure of a person , who was speaking to a lady that sat just before <page type="Page 98"/> me - My mind hesitated , but my heart admitted not a doubt that it was Captain L -
</p>
<p>
Had I ever screamed out in my life , I should have done so then - So unexpected a view had the same effect on me that is generally produced by thunder and lightning ; it dimmed my sight , and gave me such a sickness in my stomach that I could not long support ; a sudden chilness succeeded this emotion , and my head reclined insensibly on the shoulder of the lady who sat next to me .
</p>
<p>
What passed while I remained in that state , I know not , but when my senses returned , I found myself at home , my mother weeping by me , and Mr. W - storming about the room like a madman <page type="Page 99"/> - not at my illness , but at the cause he imputed it to - for he declared , before the surgeon who had just then bled me , that he had detected me in an intrigue ; and that on his sudden and unexpected appearance , in the Rooms , at the moment I was conferring with my galant , the various passions of love , hatred , and fear , had overpowered my spirits , and occasioned my fainting .
</p>
<p>
What an infatuated distemper is jealousy !
it realises chimeras , and draws conclusions , without premises - I was holding no conference with Captain L - he was only speaking to a person who sat before me , nor did I see my husband , till I opened my eyes in my own chamber .
However I suffered him to pour forth his whole stock of causeless abuse without <page type="Page 100"/> the least interruption ; till at length , not meeting with resistance , his rage was exhausted , and the surgeon and he retired together .
</p>
<p>
I was put into bed , and determined , as soon as I was left alone , to tear the bandage off my arm , and suffer myself to bleed to death ; but before I could put my resolution in practice , a thousand reasons pressed forward to restrain my trembling hand - What had I done to merit death ?
Would not the desperate deed confirm the slander of my tyrant 's tongue ?
And could I leave my mother at once oppressed with her own grief , and my infamy !
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the love of life pleaded , though silently , even stronger than these <page type="Page 101"/> motives , and with-held me from my first attempt towards guilt - Yet , O forgive me , Edward , that I now lament I did not perpetrate the fatal deed !
I might have hoped for pardon of my first crime , but can accumulated sins find mercy !
Yet if contrition may avail a wretch , I still will dare to hope .
</p>
<p>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
</p>
<p>
Here , my Louisa , I must again break off my melancholy narrative , as I have been so much broken in upon , all day , by company , that I find it impossible to conclude it by this post ; but as the mails to Ireland are sometimes delayed by contrary winds , for several days , nay weeks , as I am told , you may possibly receive the whole story at once - I will <page type="Page 102"/> not therefore create a further interruption by talking on any other subject , but conclude as usual ,
</p>
<p>
most affectionately yours , F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
ONCE more , my sister , I return to the sad task of relating Maria 's woes ; I have not ventured to make any comment on her story , nor do I mean to attempt it : my Louisa can reason far better than I , and deduce effects from their causes .
</p>
<p>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

<p>
<page type="Page 103"/> The agitation of my spirits had reduced my mind to a state of the lowest weakness ; I wept the whole night through , and when my mother eame to my bed-side , in the morning , I was scarce able to answer her tender inquiries after my health .
</p>
<p>
She told me that Mr. W - was perfectly well acquainted with my former attachment to Captain L - , though he had never given the most distant hint of it before - She suspected Matilda for having supplied him with this information - That by some chance he had heard of his being at Bath , and came post from London , directly ; but when he arrived at his house , and heard that I was at the Rooms , he flew into the most violent passion , and said every thing <page type="Page 104"/> against me that rage and mistake could dictate .
</p>
<p>
My poor mother thought to qualify his fury , by assuring him that this was the first night I had gone into the Rooms , since his absence - Perhaps this might have confirmed his suspicion , as it looked the more like an assignation .
He hurried on his cloaths , flew immediately to the assembly , and happened unluckily , it seems , just to enter the door as Captain L - had walked up to the place where I sat .
</p>
<p>
He construed every thing against me , both appearances and surmises - ' `` Trifles light as air , '' ' &c..
In fine I was condemned , without further examination , he declared his full determination <page type="Page 105"/> not to live with me any longer , and commanded me to set out immediately for his house in Devonshire , where he would take care that I should not expose myself , or dishonour him , any more for the future
</p>
<p>
Surely never was reprieve more welcome to a sentenced wretch , than the latter part of this discourse to me - I had languished for solitude , before my husband 's error had rendered me infamous ; and earnestly wished to fly from society , before I had reason to apprehend that I should be abandoned by the world - But in my present situation , both of mind and circumstance , the idea of retirement , nay absolute seclusion from the whole universe , except my mother , was doubly dear to my sad heart .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 106"/> I started up with all the alacrity of health , and chearfulness , and cried , I am ready to obey Mr. W - ; let us be gone this moment , do not delay , my dearest mother , but let us fly for ever from this hated place , this scene of all my misery !
</p>
<p>
She answered with a sigh , ' `` Your husband has refused to let me go with you , or be a witness of the treatment , which you are too likely to receive under his tyranny - I shall behold you , or your , miseries no more , but they will prey for ever on my heart - for I have caused them all - Your filial duty , more than your own ambition , was the sole motive which has rendered you a victim to this unequal match - I respected the opinions of the world , more than the <page type="Page 107"/> philosophy of nature , and the sin of the parent is now severely visited on the unoffending child ! '' '
- We wept in each other 's bosom .
</p>
<p>
The thought of being separated from this virtuous , this tender parent , quite overpowered me , and I sunk almost senseless upon my pillow - I knew that she had not now even the means of subsistence , when torn from me , and I had not the least reason to expect that Mr. W - would have generosity or humanity sufficient to relieve her distress , or assuage her grief .
</p>
<p>
During the few days I remained at Bath , after this event , I never stirred out of my bed-chamber , nor saw any creature , except my dear mother and a maid <page type="Page 108"/> servant , who had been hired upon this occasion , to watch , rather than attend me , and was appointed , as one may well suppose , to be a spy upon all my actions during my exilement in Devonshire .
</p>
<p>
The only favourable circumstance that I remember , in this unhappy situation , was that Mr. W - , for I will no longer stile him husband , no more distressed me with his loathsome presence , or his foul reproaches , while I continued under his roof .
</p>
<p>
Matilda never once came near me all this while ; but this was not the first instance that gave me reason to suspect her of insincerity and double dealing .
I feared she had been the sole cause of the breach between Captain L - <page type="Page 109"/> and me , and this idea not only inspired me with my former passion for him , but added a tenderness and compassion to my sentiments , that rendered me infinitely more wretched than I was before : the brutality of Mr. W - still further strengthened my affections towards him , and the state of divorce to which his violence had now reduced me , dissolved that solemn and honourable tie , which would otherwise have restrained the wanderings of my heart , and ever preserved my duty faithful to him .
</p>
<p>
It would be impossible to describe the pangs I felt , when the hour arrived in which I was to be torn from a fond mother 's converse - she was all the world to me , at least she was all that I then thought truly loved me , in the world - <page type="Page 110"/> We parted - and at her most earnest entreaty , I promised to write to Mr. W - , as soon as my mind should be sufficiently composed , and to enter into a proper vindication of my hitherto irreproachable conduct .
</p>
<p>
More dead than alive , my duenna and I arrived at my destined prison - The house was old , large , and gloomy , extremely out of repair ; the furniture as antique as the building , which was situated on a bleak and barren shore , opposite the Irish coast .
- For the first ten or twelve days that I passed in this dismal mansion , I was delighted with the stillness and solitude that surrounded me - the family was composed of only three maids , and an old gardener ; and I have sometimes passed a dozen hours <page type="Page 111"/> without hearing any sound , except the roaring of the sea , the croaking of the ravens , or howling of a mastiff .
</p>
<p>
But when the agitation of my mind began a little to subside , I grew sensible to the horrors of my situation , and would have preferred a dungeon , with any human creature I could converse with , to the liberty of stalking through an uninhabited range of chambers , in silence and solitude .
</p>
<p>
Monasteries afford society , and goals are not destitute of companions , which are a solace even in misery ; but here I was both wretched , and alone - I used often to consider myself as a delinquent entombed alive , secluded from the universe , and only conscious of existence from continued regret .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 112"/> I sought for amusement in books , and found none that were capable of affording me any ; the few volumes that I met with , were meant to inspire devotion , but as they were written on fanatical principles , they were either so ridiculously absurd as to create disgust , or so extremely rigid as to induce despair .
</p>
<p>
In conformity to my promise , I had written to Mr. W - , but received no answer , and , what was infinitely more grievous to me , I had not the happiness of hearing once from my mother , or any one else , though eight months had lagged with leaden steps along , since the first day of my confinement .
</p>
<p>
When the weather permitted , I sometimes walked by the sea side , and have <page type="Page 113"/> frequently poured forth my sorrows to the deaf , unpitying waves .
- Often , my Edward , have I sighed out your name , and sent forth ardent prayers for your return , to comfort and support our hapless mother !
Yet I will own that the loved sound of L - , still oftener passed my lips - Was this a crime ?
My affections were thrown back upon my hands , and this methought gave me a right to transfer them .
</p>
<p>
In this situation I had remained in my exile for a tedious interval , when one fine evening , having indulged my reveries by the sea side longer than usual , the twilight coming on warned me of returning home , when I saw two men , at a small distance , walking slowly behind me - a sight so unusual , joined to an apprehension <page type="Page 114"/> that they might have overheard my soliloquy , put my spirits into a flutter ; though from their pace and manner , they did not seem as if they intended to pursue me - I was seized with an universal tremor , my limbs could scarce support me , and I could march but slowly on .
</p>
<p>
Before I was able to recover myself , and mend my speed , one of the persons came up to me , while the other retired , as if for fear of alarming me - I did not venture even to look at him , and began to mend my pace ; but sight was useless , when his well known voice uttered these words , ' `` O fear no injury from me , my dear deceived , unhappy , and still adored Maria ! '' '
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 115"/> Surprise , terror , hope , fear , love , anger , grief , and joy - in short every passion of the human heart , hatred alone excepted , rushed through my mind , and totally deprived me of the power of utterance , while he - need I write his name ?
- taking advantage of my silence , proceeded thus .

<p>
' `` I have long sought this opportunity of speaking to you ; but my tenderness , my delicacy , and respect , for the only woman I ever did , or can love , have prevented my attempting it hitherto , in any way that might reflect upon the character of Mr. W - 's wife , and by that means countenance and justify the calumny with which he has aspersed your reputation - The lucky moment I have so long watched <page type="Page 116"/> for in private , has at length arrived , and if you ever loved me , my Maria , you will not now refuse to hear me , for a moment , while I tell you that you have been most cruelly deceived . '' '
</p>
<p>
' `` I know , it Sir , I replied ; you need not now inform me of your own perfidy - to you alone I owe the miseries I suffer , and Mr. W - himself is innocent , when compared with you - Then let me go this moment , for however my duty to him may have been dissolved , by his unkindness , that which I owe myself , forbids my ever holding converse with you more . '' '
</p>
<p>
I attempted to break from him , but he held me fast , and vowed most solemnly , that he would never quit me , unless <page type="Page 117"/> I promised to meet him , the next evening , on the beach , and allow him to exculpate himself of the infidelity I charged him with , and which he then denied with the strongest asseverations ; adding , that Matilda had betrayed us both , and was the vilest being upon earth - Then promised , if I would but hear him once , he would never importune me more .
</p>
<p>
Almost distracted with contending passions , and terrified lest his imprudence might involve me in farther difficulties , I promised to comply with his request , provided he would leave me on the instant , as I heard the sound of voices , which I knew to be the servants coming in quest of me , as they must necessarily be alarmed at my unusual st [ ... ] y - He pressed my hand to his lips , and withdrew directly .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 118"/> With trembling steps I pursued my way homewards , and met my maid , with the gardener , coming in search of me - The agitation of my mind , was too visible in my countenance to pass unnoticed , and they naturally inquired if I had met with any fright or accident ?
I told them that the night had fallen upon me sooner than I had expected it , that I had been then alarmed at the loneliness of my situation , and the haste I was obliged to make homewards had hurried my spirits a little - I desired a glass of water , and pretended to retire to rest .
</p>
<p>
As soon as I was left alone , I began to reflect upon the extraordinariness of my adventure with Captain L - upon the strand , and on my own weakness in having consented again to meet a person <page type="Page 119"/> who had despised and rejected me with the utmost insolence and inhumanity .
</p>
<p>
It was however , still easier to account for my conduct , on this occasion , than for his ; passion , self-love , and curiosity , all conspired to render me desirous of finding a clue to that labyrinth in which I was involved .
But wherefore should he seek to distress me farther ?
Or why pursue a wretch , who , already intirely secluded from the world , had neither inclination or power to disturb his happiness , or oppose his views in any scheme of life ?
</p>
<p>
The hints he had dropped about Matilda , puzzled me still farther - Was she not the companion of my youth , the friend of my heart , the confidant of all <page type="Page 120"/> my joys and sorrows - Some instances of her levity and unkindness I did indeed recollect - But could she betray me !
impossible !
Nature could not produce so vile a monster !
</p>
<p>
Or grant there could be such a fiend cloathed in a female form - Yet still why unprovoked should she exert her malice against me , who never had offended her , without a view to her own interest or advantage ?
And how could she be profited by my destruction ?
</p>
<p>
The more I considered what Captain L - had said , on this last subject , the less credit it gained with me ; and I persuaded myself that he had only named Matilda as a lure to my curiosity .
- The night passed away insensibly , without my being able either to form any rational <page type="Page 121"/> conjecture , with regard to the motives of his behaviour , or any resolution relative to my own - A thousand times I determined not to keep my appointment with him , and as often changed my resolves .
</p>
<p>
It would be endless to repeat the numless arguments for , and against this meeting , that my love and reason suggested , and set in opposition to each other .
- At length my evil genius prevailed , and determined me , for once , to hear what Captain L - could say .
</p>
<p>
About six o'clock in the morning , I lay down on my bed , in order to make my maid believe that I had slept in it as usual ; I had lain but a short time , when I found my harrassed mind inclined <page type="Page 122"/> to rest , and I fell into a slumber ; out of which I was soon awakened by a dream , which affected my mind as much as a vision would have done my senses .
</p>
<p>
I thought that my father stood before me , under the same sickly and emaciated appearance , with which that true divine conferred his last blessing on me - I threw myself on my knees , and endeavoured to embrace his ; but with his face averse he flitted fast away - I rose and pursued him to the brink of a precipice , when he turned quick upon me , caught me up in his arms , and plunged with me directly into the gulph .
</p>
<p>
I awakened with a loud scream , thought I was still falling , and was for some time in doubt whether it was the reverie of a <page type="Page 123"/> disturbed brain , or an apparition that had occurred to me ; and only determined it to have been the former , by finding myself in the same place I had laid down to rest .
</p>
<p>
I rose up and walked about the room , till I had exhausted my strength , endeavouring to shake off the kind of horror which had taken possession of my mind and body , from this shocking dream ; but it clung still about me , like a wintry cloud , and chilled my nerves to numbness .
</p>
<p>
At length , towards evening , I began to recover myself again - I am not superstitious ; besides , what crime had I ever committed , that might conjure up spectres from the grave !
My life had been <page type="Page 124"/> innocent , though unhappy , and my mind continued pure , though injured and provoked .
</p>
<p>
The reflections which this incident stirred up in my thoughts , more particularly at this time , with regard to my dear father 's goodness and virtue , served principally to compose my spirits to peace - He was indeed a perfect christian , both in faith and works ; his character and conversation were of a piece ; his example was precept , he urged no borrowed morals , but preached the very practice of his life - his doctrines were strict , yet indulgent ; charitable , though severe - his austerity was only in his maxims and his mind ; his mildness in his censures and his heart .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 125"/> These pious thoughts wrought me up to an enthusiasm of devotion ; I fell on my knees to thank Heaven for having been derived from two such pure sources , as my father and mother , and prayed most fervently , that I might never be guilty of any thought or deed , which should render me unworthy of such faultless originals .
</p>
<p>
As the hour approached when I was to meet Captain L - , the terrors of my mind increased ; yet I found myself so strongly impelled , from the motives already mentioned , joined to a curiosity to know where the blame lay , between Matilda and him , that I could not resist the temptation of hazarding the interview .
I went softly down the back stairs , which led from a closet within my apartment , <page type="Page 126"/> and found my way out , unseen by any of the family .
</p>
<p>
The agitation of my spirits was so violent , that I scarce knew what I did ; I sometimes ran towards the shore , as if I had been pursued by wild beasts ; then stopped , and stood motionless , as if my faculties had ceased .
- At length , I perceived Captain L - , at some distance ; he flew to me , and caught me in his arms ; I burst into a passion of tears , and was incapable of utterance .
</p>
<p>
As soon as I could recover my speech , I assumed all the dignity of resentment , and told him that he was no longer to consider me as the weak tender Maria S - , but as an injured and offended judge , who came to hear the poor defence <page type="Page 127"/> which he could make , for having so ungenerously wronged , and so cruelly injured her .
</p>
<p>
Again he pressed me to his bosom , and exclaimed , ' `` O could I but repair the wrongs you have suffered , as easily as I can prove I never was the author of them , my loved Maria should be mine and happy - and it shall still be so - Victims of artifice and fraud , shall we continue to be wretched , because Matilda and your husband have concurred to render us so . '' '
</p>
<p>
' `` That fatal name of husband , I replied , has fixed an everlasting bar , between happiness and me ; but were there no such person in the world , you can not think of me so meanly , to suppose that <page type="Page 128"/> I would condescend to accept of one , who had rejected and despised me !
- No blandishments , no arts , can ever soothe my tortured mind into forgetfulness of your contempt . '' '
</p>
<p>
He then begged that I would hear him justify himself , and began by informing me , that about a year before my arrival at Bath , he had gone there , as most young people do , in quest of amusement ; that he happened to lodge in the same house with Matilda , and her husband , who both sought and cultivated his acquaintance ; and as he had no particular attachment to any other persons there , he devoted himself intirely to them , was of all their parties , and never absent from them .
</p>
<p>
He confessed that he liked Matilda , better than any woman then at Bath , and <page type="Page 129"/> that he began to flatter himself he was not disagreeable to her ; from the levity of her manners , he had reason to believe she was not overstrict in her morals , and on her husband 's being obliged to go to London , for a few days , she convinced him that he had not been mistaken .
</p>
<p>
Their guilty commerce lasted but a short time ; it began without passion , and of course terminated in indifference , at least on his side .
He quitted Bath without any design of ever returning , though Matilda and her husband had taken a house , and determined to fix their residence there .
</p>
<p>
Some months after , he was attacked with a violent bilious complaint , and ordered to Bath by his physicians ; and <page type="Page 130"/> was just recovering from this disorder , when my mother and I happened to bend our course thither - What passed between us , on our first acquaintance , I have already told you , except Matilda 's machinations to break off our intercourse , and recall him to his former attachment .
</p>
<p>
When she found her arts were unsuccessful , she changed her battery , and pretended to conceive a particular friendship for me , and became our mutual confidant ; but at the same time , from her superior regard for Captain L - , used often to remonstrate to him , how much his family would be offended at his marrying a girl without rank or fortune .
</p>
<p>
But all these arts and insinuations he vowed had not the least manner of effect <page type="Page 131"/> upon his mind , or heart ; his passion was too firmly founded , on admiration and esteem , to be so easily shaken , and he declared that at the sad moment of our parting , his whole affections and sole purpose in life , were pointed towards our mutual happiness and honour together .
</p>
<p>
He confessed , however , that during the unlucky interval of absence , the hints and representations of Matilda had wrought by degrees , the malicious effect intended by them ; for she had framed a novel against me , with so much address and ingenuity , so guarded at all points , that each part of it seemed to vouch the truth of the rest .
</p>
<p>
Even the indiscretion of my having been led into play , by her own artifice , <page type="Page 132"/> she most wickedly represented to him as a vice of mine , and reported the circumstances of my debt to Mr. W - , which she also exaggerated , with such reflections as placed me in the shocking light of a girl who was resolved to make the most of her youth and beauty , without any further regard to morals or character .
</p>
<p>
In fine , he acknowledged that the plausible manner in which she gave him these advices , from time to time , with the tender and compassionate expressions she affected now and then to let drop , upon the unhappiness of my conduct , had at length so intirely injured me in his esteem , that it occasioned his writing me the letter , before mentioned , when he was going to set sail for America .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 133"/> What a recital was this for me to listen to , in my then unfortunate circumstances !
his justification but increased my misery - I had never imagined there was so much vileness in human nature , as the base Matilda appeared now to be capable of , and was shocked to think that I was of the same species with such a monster in wickedness - I wept - We both of us wept , while he thus went on with his story .
</p>
<p>
' `` When I quitted Europe , continued he , the poison of Matilda 's correspondence ceased its operations , my passion and reflection had liberty to exert themselves , and I began to doubt the authenticity of the extraordinary accounts I had received about you - Your bloom <page type="Page 134"/> and beauty presented themselves to my fond imagination , in the warmest colours - Your candour , innocence , and ingenuousness of manners , occurred then strongly to my mind - Could such a character become so quickly abandoned , said I to my heart - It must be unnatural ; and what is contrary to nature , must be improbable at least , if not impossible . '' '
</p>
<p>
' `` Thus did I often plead your cause , my ever loved Maria , against the foul charges of your enemy , whom I unhappily , however , did not look upon then in that light , but merely as an unfortunate woman , who having been guilty of vice herself , was , as too generally is the case , apt to construe every action of others into the worst <page type="Page 135"/> sense , that the appearances or circumstances of it can bear . '' '
</p>
<p>
' `` Upon this fair discussion of the point , I wrote once more to Matilda , expressing my doubts , not of her sincerity , but about her misapprehensions only , of your conduct - Said that general charges , suspicions and hearsays , were but insufficient evidences where so choice a jewel as character was at stake ; and called upon her for some facts of more public notoriety , to support her slanders . '' '
</p>
<p>
' `` As all correspondence had been broken off between you and me , said he , she ventured now to speak out more boldly , and without the least equivocation in her terms , assured me <page type="Page 136"/> that you lived publicly with Mr. W - , and privately intrigued with Sir James D - ; that the extravagance of your dress , pleasures , and other expences , was supported between them ; that you had kept them both attached to you , by raising a spirit of rivalship between them ; and used also to render each of the galants jealous , in their turns , by alarming them with me . '' '
</p>
<p>
' `` With the letter she wrote , as she said by your desire , from Bristol , she sent me another , in which she told me that you had at length brought Mr. W - , to consent to marry you , on account of your being with child , and that the letter was framed with a view either of duping me into a marriage , which she believed you would <page type="Page 137"/> prefer , or of paying Mr. W - the compliment of sacrificing me to him , if I should return a favourable answer . '' '
</p>
<p>
' `` There is no describing the height of resentment to which I was affected upon this occasion , and I should have replied to the proposal in the most outrageous terms imaginable , if my love and fondness for you , which still remained , though my esteem was flown , had not restrained my hand , and dictated those cool , but not violent lines , I sent her in answer . '' '
</p>
<p>
He told me , that when he returned to England , upon his father 's illness , he felt himself impelled by a strong desire of seeking some proper opportunity of reproaching me for my infidelity , and of <page type="Page 138"/> covering me with the utmost confusion , by expressing the detestation and contempt , that even a man , and a soldier , was capable of conceiving at the breach of honour or virtue in a woman that he loved .
</p>
<p>
He mentioned this purpose , he said , in a letter to Matilda , and she most strenuously opposed it ; she told him that such a sentiment was no good sign of a recovery from his infatuated passion , for she feared much that ' `` All the malice of his heart was love . '' '
That this would be but affording me the triumph of thinking him still my slave , and might put it in my power to involve him , perhaps , in a duel with Mr. W - , whom she represented as extremely jealous , from very conscious reasons , if , as <page type="Page 139"/> it was more than probable , I should be willing to exchange my wedding-garment for a widow 's weed .
</p>
<p>
However all these arguments not being sufficient to deter him from coming to Bath , he wrote her word that he would be there on such a day , and has had reason to suppose , since , that she must have advised Mr. W - of this particular , by his coming so critically from London , on the same day , and meeting him in the Rooms that fatal night which I have before mentioned to you .
</p>
<p>
I need not now , my dear brother , recapitulate what passed , in consequence of this vile woman 's malice ; you have hitherto seen me the innocent victim of her cruelty - Too happy should I now deem myself , had I still remained so .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 140"/> My fainting in the Rooms , at the sight of Captain L - , awakened his former tenderness for me ; and the inhumanity with which Mr. W - treated me , on that occasion , for the surgeon had made the story public , seemed to demand his pity for a wretch doomed to be punished for an involuntary and guiltless act .
</p>
<p>
He would have gone in person , the next morning , to Mr. W - , in order to have justified my character , as far as it related to the scandal then cast upon it , with regard to him , but was restrained from the attempt by Matilda 's saying that this would only make the matter worse , in all probability ; that the interfering between man and wife was a dangerous measure in any person whatsoever , <page type="Page 141"/> but that the lover , the very cause of the contention , must certainly be the most improper mediator in their reconcilement , that could possibly be imagined .
</p>
<p>
She , therefore , advised him to wait with patience , till passion , on the husband 's part , might become calm enough to listen to reason , and that resentment peculiarly natural to a wife , suspected in the wrong place , ( this was her expression ) should have somewhat subsided , and then promised him to undertake the interposition herself , at the proper crisis , probably to better effect than it could be engaged in , even by her , during the present violence of the parties .
</p>
<p>
He stayed at Bath while I remained there , and suffered an anxiety which increased <page type="Page 142"/> more and more , every day , a [ ... ] by mixing with the company at th [ ... ] Rooms , but more particularly with th [ ... ] residents of the place , among whom m [ ... ] late adventure was publicly talked o [ ... ] he heard every one take my part , an [ ... ] vindicate my innocence , from their former knowledge and general good opinion of my character and conduct , eve [ ... ] since I had first become an inhabitan [ ... ] of that city .
</p>
<p>
In fine , he heard it agreed upon , o [ ... ] all sides , that Mr. W - could have n [ ... ] other foundation for his jealousy of m [ ... ] except that sort of suspicion which is naturally apt to arise from too great a di [ ... ] parity in years , especially in the breast o [ ... ] a man , who had had but little acquain [ ... ] ance with any women , except those of [ ... ] profligate character .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 143"/> These fair reports in my favour , he said , began soon to convince him of Matilda 's treachery , and he reproached her with it warmly one day ; when with the greatest sang froid imaginable , she answered him in these very words , ' `` There is no such thing as eleemosynary wisdom in this life , let philosophers and pedagogues say what they will - experience must be purchased at our own proper cost , and not at the expence of others - From this warning you will be taught sufficient sense to know , for the future , that to make a woman the confidant of her rival , is appointing a wolf to be the shepherd of a lamb - I forget whether this maxim be taken notice of in Ovid 's Art of Love ; if not , his precepts are imperfect . '' '
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 144"/> He assured me that , on this reply , his sight and reason forsook him , for a time , and only returned to enable him to view the hag , as she then appeared to him , with the greater horror , and to possess him with a rage that fell but little short of madness . '
`` What would I have given , at that instant , cried he out , to have exchanged her sex , into a dozen armed men ! '' '
and then concluded the sentence with this expression - ' `` But I could not exert such resentment against her , as she deserved , because she was in my power . '' '
</p>
<p>
He did every thing he could to find out the place of my banishment , but could not discover it - He did not know of my being moved from Bath till after I had been sent away , or he would have <page type="Page 145"/> employed some trusty person or other , to have watched me to the place of my destination - The surmises were various , upon this occasion ; some said I was to be carried over to France , and forced into a convent ; some , that I was to be locked up in Mr. W - 's house , in London ; and others , that I was to be betrayed into a private mad-house , and confined there for life .
</p>
<p>
During the uncertainty of all these several reports , Captain L - received an account of his father 's illness , and immediately repaired to London , to attend on him .
His filial duty claimed his first regard , and the exercise of that virtue served to restrain his impatience , and ballance his anxiety on my account , for several months , while Sir Richard L - lingered before his death .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 146"/> Captain L - , now become Sir Thomas L - , with a large patrimony , being at length released from any further restraint upon his time and actions , began to turn his whole thoughts towards the unhappiness of my situation , and considered himself bound , not as a knight-errant merely , but as a man of honour , to rescue me from that distress which he had been the innocent cause of , through the treachery of one person , and the too hasty sentence and unwarrantable severity of another .
- He returned immediately to Bath , in order to get what information he could , about me ; and hearing that my dear mother had retired to a village in Flintshire , took the resolution of going to wait upon her there .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 147"/> As soon as he had informed her who he was , she began to reproach him in the manner it was natural for her to have done , from the circumstances of his conduct towards me , in the light it had hitherto appeared to her .
But when he had disclosed the scene of villainy and deceit to which he had likewise fallen a victim , her affections softened , and she could not help looking upon him then as a third sufferer in our complicated misfortune .
</p>
<p>
He contrived artfully to draw from her the secret of my abode , but without suffering the least hint to escape him , of any purpose to seek me there .
Then , taking her hand , and kneeling before her , vowed an attachment to me , during life ; said he would ever pay her the <page type="Page 148"/> respect and duty of a son-in-law , attending till death , or some more speedy vengeance , might remove Mr. W - out of the way of his happiness ; and offered her an affluent support out of his fortune , becoming the honourable connection which he had then declared between them .
</p>
<p>
My dear unhappy mother returned him the most grateful thanks for the kindness and generosity of his offer , but her spirit and delicacy made her decline the acceptance of it .
She confessed herself alarmed , even at his visit , and urged him to depart instantly , without suffering himself to be known , lest this circumstance , though accidental and innocent in itself , might possibly , in the train of our misfortunes , happen to be <page type="Page 149"/> made an additional article of suspicion against us all .
She plained the distress and difficulty of our situations - They embraced , and he retired immediately out of the town .
</p>
<p>
On his route to Devonshire Bath lay in his way , where he happened to meet with Captain R - , who had been an officer in the same corps with him , in America .
There had always subsisted a particular intimacy between them ; and as friendship is apt to inspire a confidence , and that his heart was full , he imparted the whole secret of our loves and disappointments to him .
</p>
<p>
He also informed him , at the same time , of his resolve to go and conceal himself somewhere near the place of my retirement , <page type="Page 150"/> till he might meet with a favourable opportunity , without hazard to my reputation , of seeing me even for a minute , in order to vindicate himself from the unjust opinion I must necessarily have conceived of his infidelity and baseness ; declaring also , that he thought it a duty incumbent on him to watch over my destiny , and at the expence of his fortune , and the sacrifice of his life , to defend me from any injury or violence that might ever be attempted against me .
</p>
<p>
Captain R - approved his motives , and commended his purpose , and said that as it was a service of danger , he had a right to claim the privilege of a friend and a comrade , in sharing it with him - Sir Thomas readily accepted of his company , and they set out the next <page type="Page 151"/> morning for Hartland , which is within a mile of the castle where I resided .
They were attended only by two servants , and a couple of pointers , on pretence of going into that country merely as unconnected idle travelling sportsmen .
</p>
<p>
Sir Thomas did not acquaint his friend with my name , nor where I was concealed , and used every morning and evening to wander alone round the place of my confinement , in hopes of seeing me , as I should walk abroad , and of speaking to me unobserved ; which , after about a fortnight 's attendance , he happened to meet with .
</p>
<p>
In this sweet , but dangerous converse , did we pass the minute , for to us it appeared no more , of our assignation ; and <page type="Page 152"/> now judge me , Edward , with your wonted candor , nor blame this foolish heart , if every tender , every fond sensation it had ever felt , returned with double force !
Remember that I had never loved another , and that I still loved him , even when I thought him false !
What must my transports be , to find him true !
</p>
<p>
When , in my turn , I told him the inhuman arts that had been practised to betray me , and estrange our mutual confidence , his passions rose almost to madness , and he a thousand times exclaimed that I was still his wife , that our hearts were joined by heaven , and that no power on earth , should ever part us more !
</p>
<p>
Too eagerly I listened to his ravings , and suffered the enchantment of his voice <page type="Page 153"/> to lull asleep my prudence , and my reason - I felt as if there were but us alone of all our species , existing in this world , and all other connection , obligation , or regard , appeared to me then but metaphysical speculation - Our sad attention to each other 's woes , had so intirely engrossed our thoughts , that night stole on us , almost unperceived ; tears had quite dimmed my sight , and my weak trembling limbs needed assistance to support my weight - I could not then refuse his kind sustaining arm , to help me on toward the mansion of my sorrows , the dungeon of my misery .
</p>
<p>
While we were on our way , a sudden storm arose , and the clouds burst forth in horrid thunder and lightning .
By the time we had come within sight of the <page type="Page 154"/> back-door , through which I had that evening stolen out ; a violent shower came on , which obliged me to hasten my speed - I intreated him to leave me , but he held me fast by the arm , till we came to the house , which he entered along with me .
</p>
<p>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
</p>
<p>
Here drop the curtain , Edward !
and let this first false step of my whole life , stand as a mark for the innocent and unwary to shun - Let them restrain the first encroachments of a favoured lover , nor vainly fancy when once they yield the reins , that they can after check the ardent courser 's speed .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 155"/> Till that unhappy night , guilt was a stranger to my suffering heart , and therefore I had never known remorse , or fear - It was impossible to soothe my tortured soul to peace - The fond delusion of his prior right , both to my person and my heart - My former arguments , of dissolved tie , and transferred [ ... ] ffections , appeared all but self-deceit , in my present circumstances ; the wretched sophistry vanished like a phantom , from me , and in its room the priest , the altar , all the awful scene , where I had bound myself by solemn vows to be another 's wife , now rushed upon me ; and in the anguish of my heart , I bitterly exclaimed against him , as the prime source of all my misery , and bad him fly , for ever , from my sight .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 156"/> Sir Thomas said every thing that honour could dictate , or love inspire , to temper my emotions of grief and rage ; threw himself at my feet , intreated my forgiveness , called me his wife , his betrothed before heaven , vowed eternal faith and constancy to me , and offered to fly with me to any part of the globe .
At length , seeing that nothing could calm my distraction , he started up , laid his hand to his sword , and declared that he would instantly put an end to that existence , which my resentment had now rendered miserable to him .
</p>
<p>
His violence suspended for a time , my agitations , by adding terror to my other feelings - I caught hold of his arm , and now became a suppliant , in my turn , begging that he would not further injure <page type="Page 157"/> me by such an horrid outrage , and promising to compose my mind by penitence and prayer , as soon as I was left alone ; but upon this condition only , that he should never attempt to see me again , till it was possible for us to meet , for life , without a crime .
We parted , mutually wretched , in agony and despair .
</p>
<p>
The horror with which I was seized , the moment he had quitted me , is not to be conceived , without guilt .
I lost that firmness now , which had hitherto born up my spirits under all my sufferings .
Purity , the only resource in affliction , was now fled for ever from my breast - I felt the full weight of all my ills ; and what appeared before oppression on my innocence , seemed now but justice on my crime .
I rejoiced I had <page type="Page 158"/> no sister !
I thought of you , my brother , of my dear mother too , and with a shower of tears , took leave of these fond names , for ever .
</p>
<p>
I stood in life alone , severed from all connection !
The sustaining hope of being again restored to honour and society , like the fair fruit that sprang in Pandaemonium , now turned to bitter ashes .
What had I further to do with the world ?
Alas , I had already forfeited all protection !
My last night 's dream - say rather vision - stared me full in the face , and upbraided me with the recollection of a maxim I had often heard my parent saint deliver , that ' `` we should ever consider those persons we had a respect for , as present , when absent , and as living , when dead . '' '
I kneeled down , and <page type="Page 159"/> strove to pray , but could not ; I felt myself in a state of reprobation , and was almost fallen into despair - I had no stay , no support , no resource , in store - In all the other ills of life , heaven suffers us not to be afflicted , beyond our strength ; but wretchedness , with guilt , exceeds the scheme of Providence .
</p>
<p>
I then endeavoured to rise , but was not able to stand - my exhausted spirits failed me , and I sunk down again upon the floor , where I continued some time , in a state of stupidity ; till my maid 's opening the door of the ante-chamber , warned me to disguise my disturbance - I concealed my distraction as well as I could , by keeping my face turned from her as much as possible , and for the first time felt what an irksome thing it is to have any thing to hide .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 160"/> The storm continued all the night , with extreme violence ; but the thunder and lightning did not alarm me as they had done on the evening before - I had now a louder monitor in my breast than the one , and with what open arms and welcome greetings , should I then have embraced the other !
</p>
<p>
How long Sir Thomas staid at Hartland I can not tell , for I never ventured abroad , from that time , even to take a walk in the gardens , and he behaved with so much honour as to obey my last injunction to him , by not seeking any further opportunity , as far as I could learn , of seeing me again , or even of attempting to write a line to me , lest it might , as it certainly would , have been intercepted .
So that I began soon to reconcile <page type="Page 161"/> myself to my present situation , by making that solitude and confinement a voluntary penance , which I had hitherto looked upon as the severest infliction ; considering it but as a convent within the sequestered walls of which I should then most assuredly have concealed myself from the world , had I been at liberty to have chosen my situation .
</p>
<p>
I conformed myself intirely to a true monastic state , for a time , by spending my days in fasts , in contrition , and in prayer , hoping that my sorrows would ere long have ended with my life ; but I was , alas !
too soon convinced that fate had not yet emptied all its quiver against me ; for I had the inexpressible shock to find that I was likely to bring an innocent being into the world , at once to prove , and share my infamy .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 162"/> I shall not attempt to describe the agonies of my mind , upon this discovery - I must live to have endeavoured still to solicit that death , which my despair had tempted me to wish so ardently for before , while it related only to myself , would have been a double guilt , in my present circumstances - I must therefore submit to become more miserable , in order to render myself less criminal .
</p>
<p>
In such a miserable and forlorn situation , what measure was left me to pursue !
There was indeed , but one ; and let the fatal necessity of it , plead my excuse - I had refused to fly with Sir Thomas , when he begged it on his knees ; I could not yield deliberate consent to vice , or think of delivering myself <page type="Page 163"/> over to a life of profligacy .
But I must now temporize with guilt - I must now extricate myself from my present difficulty , shame , and danger , at any expence ; though with a determined purpose to cover my head , immediately after , in some severe convent , there to endure the harshest penances , and hide me from the world for ever .
</p>
<p>
In the confusion and distraction I was in at that time , I could not frame any certain scheme for my relief ; besides , that point depended on the concurrence of another ; I therefore wrote a letter to Sir Thomas , entreating the favour of him to come to me directly , upon a business of consequence to us both , and in which something more than my own life , was the object of my anxiety .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 164"/> I did not know where Sir Thomas then was , but ventured to direct it to him according to my former address from Bath , to his father 's house in Bloomsbury square .
</p>
<p>
But when I had sealed this billet , a new difficulty occured to me , how I could possibly get it conveyed to him - All connection between me and the world had been cut off , from the moment of my commitment .
My duenna had , at first , refused to let a letter from me , even to my mother , be carried to the post ; and told me frankly then , that any directed to me were ordered to be returned from thence , unopened , to Mr. W -
</p>
<p>
The danger pressed , and some attempt must be hazarded .
I recollected <page type="Page 165"/> that there was a labourer who generally worked in the garden , and appeared to be a person of rational intelligence ; I therefore went out to him , and gave the letter into his hands , with a bribe of five guineas , which fee I promised to double for him , on his return with an answer , and hinted to him all proper cautions , with regard to the secrecy of his commission .
</p>
<p>
I instructed the messenger to make some pretence or other , of private business , for absenting himself from his service , and desired him not to attempt to deliver the answer of my letter to me , till he should meet me alone in the garden - I had a full view of it from the windows of my apartment , and watched with the utmost impatience , for his appearance <page type="Page 166"/> again , from the moment that I thought it possible for him to have returned .
How much did I envy , during this anxious interval , the infinitely preferable state of the meanest peasant I heard whistling carelessly across the demesne , who enjoyed peace and competence , without a consciousness of guilt , or the fear of detection !
</p>
<p>
At length I had the satisfaction to see my courier arrive , and waiting till I perceived the coast clear , I stole out to him , and had the pleasure to receive a letter from Sir Thomas , filled with the tenderest professions of love , and the fullest assurances of honour .
He promised to be with me that very evening , just at night fall , and desired I would meet him at the end of the grove , near the house .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 167"/> I was punctual to time and place , and found him also exact to his appointment .
</p>
<p>
He was full of transport at the sight of me , but I was not in a fit disposition of mind to attend to his extasies - I begged he would compose himself while I looked about through every avenue , to see that no prying eye was near , to observe our motions ; then led him with fearful hands , and trembling steps , into the house , and we retired up stairs together , to my apartment .
</p>
<p>
As I had not used myself to eat suppers , ever since my confinement in this place , I always dismissed my attendant as soon as she had left candles lighted on my table , chusing to sit up alone , most part of the nights , employed <page type="Page 168"/> in reading , musing , and working ; so that I was under no sort of apprehension , of being at any time interrupted in my privacy .
</p>
<p>
As soon as we had got into the room , Sir Thomas attempted to catch me in his arms , but I started from his embrace - I told him that we were neither of us in time , place , or circumstances , to admit of unwarrantable liberties ; that I had desired this meeting to implore the assistance of his friendship and honour only , not to receive his love ; the least overture of which , as I had declared to him before , I was firmly resolved to oppose , till such a time , if ever that happy aera should arrive , as might intitle him to ask , and me to grant , the unreserved completion of his <page type="Page 169"/> wishes - With true humanity and generous acquiescence he immediately desisted from all further importunity .
</p>
<p>
As he guessed the situation I was in , from the hint in my letter , and therefore concluded what the purport of my summons tended to , he had the tenderness and politeness not to wait for any further explanation of the matter ; but immediately proposed to me that we should directly abscond together to some distant part of the kingdom , from whence we might sail over to the continent , and there secrete ourselves for life , in some retired spot , safe from pursuit or inquiry ; adding that he should not look upon this retreat to be an exile , to himself , as he might well be said to carry his country along with him , while he <page type="Page 170"/> was in possession of all he loved or valued in it .
</p>
<p>
I had no other resource left me now ; and the choice is soon made , where there remains but one option - I rendered the most grateful acknowledgments to him for the generosity of his offer , which I readily accepted of ; told him that I , from that moment , resigned my fate into his hands , and that he should thence-forward be the sole arbiter of my destiny , accountable to himself alone for all my future weal or woe - He kneeled , took my hand , kissed and bathed it with his tears .
</p>
<p>
You do not , I hope , my dear brother , imagine me so devoid of sensibility , as not to suppose that I then felt the disgrace <page type="Page 171"/> which my misconduct must entail upon an honoured parent ; nor were you absent , Edward , from my thoughts .
But let me say this in my excuse , that I then flattered myself my flight , or rather the motives for it , might remain for ever secret , and that living in a foreign land , under a feigned name , my person might possibly never be dis [ ... ] overed - and in that case , those dear connections could be as little involved in my reproach , as they were concerned in my guilt .
</p>
<p>
Here end all the reflections I shall ever make - The following part of my unhappy story , while I relate it , harrows up my soul , congeals my faculties , and impels me to wild distraction , or to reprobate despair .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 172"/> When we had thus settled the article of our flight together , we agreed further upon the manner and circumstances of it : Sir Thomas was to retire immediately to his inn , before my garrison should be shut up for the night , and send off an express to Exeter , for a post-chaise , with relays of horses , to be ready , the next evening , at the further end of the grove , where I promised to meet him at the close of day , from thence to launch into a world unknown , without a matron , without a guardian - for I had lost my innocence .
</p>
<p>
Just as I was rising up to convey him out of the house , I heard some hasty steps passing through the antechamber , the door of my room was suddenly burst open , and I saw Mr. W - enter , with <page type="Page 173"/> a pistol in each hand .
Sir Thomas laid hold of his sword , but before he could draw it , received a bullet in his breast - He fell - and , do I survive to tell it !
I heard his last groan , and saw him exp [ ... ] at my feet - I heard , nor saw , no more , bu [ ... ] falling senseless on his lifeless bosom , was for a while released from agonies too great [ ... ]
</p>
<p>
But my miseries were not so soon to have an end .
I was dragged back again to life , by the still cruel hands of Mr. W - , who assisted my maid to raise me from the floor , and lay me on the bed - The first use I made of my returning sense , was to rise upon my knees , and , with uplifted hands , implore his mercy to terminate my misfortunes and my life together - He looked as if he <page type="Page 174"/> would do so , but turning from me , cried , ' `` No , thou shalt be reserved for more exemplary vengeance ; '' ' and walked immediately out of the room , taking the maid along with him , but leaving the discharged pistol by me , on the bed
</p>
<p>
With my reason , my ho [ ... ] returned - Let compassion but reflect on my situation !
Barbarity itself must soften into humanity , at the thought .
- Loaded with infamy , encompassed with misery , entombed , as it were alive , with the dead !
and gazing horribly , without the relief even of tears , on the sad victim of my ill-starred destiny !
At length , frantic with grief , with terror and despair , unknowing what I did , and without any purposed end , I rushed down the backstaris , and issued through the private door , from that accursed mansion .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 175"/> Fear gave wings to my speed , yet at the same time retarded my flight ; for though I ran as fast as it was possible , I frequently stopped , for several minutes , to listen to every sound I heard ; and sometimes clambered over high ditches , and laid myself flat on the ground , to prevent my being seen , in case I was pursued ; though the night was so dark , that I could almost feel an object before I saw it .
</p>
<p>
My haste was urged by instinct merely , determined to no point , but like a frightened animal I fled from danger without direction in my course - My mind was all the while in the state of a dream - I knew of no asylum , I could frame no purpose - At length , exhausted by fatigue , and oppressed with sorrow , <page type="Page 176"/> I sat myself down in the corner of a field , surrounded by a little coppice , just high enough to conceal me from the view of passengers - Here nature , till now restrained , still active for its own relief , began to release the utterances of grief , and at the very moment that I felt my heart going to burst asunder , my tears broke forth , and I found myself at libery to express my sufferings , in moanings and exclamations .
</p>
<p>
This gave me ease , at first , and I therefore indulged it , for a while , till I began to apprehend , towards day , that the loudness of my complaints might possibly reach the ear of some traveller or villager , and betray the situation of my concealment , and the particular circumstances of my story - But yet I could <page type="Page 177"/> not silence my cries and lamentations ; I became desperate of all human succour , and thought that even the hands of cruelty might relieve me from the effects of my own distraction , by putting an end to my life , without any additional guilt of mine .
</p>
<p>
At length my voice was heard , and answered by one who came rustling through the coppice , and in a soft slender tone , cried out , Where are you , who are you , and what ails you ?
The sound at first , alarmed me , till I was struck with the appearance of a beautiful boy , of about seven years old , at a little distance , who , as soon as he spied me , came running up and told me , that his mamma had been awakened in bed with my cries , had rung her bell , and ordered her servant <page type="Page 178"/> to go seek the person in grief , but that he got out of the house before him , was glad he had sound me first , and begged I would go home along with him , directly , out of that nasty cold place , to make his mamma 's mind easy .
</p>
<p>
The prettiness of the child 's person , with the good-natured impatience and anxiety it expressed about my situation , charmed me in that instant of distress and woe , till he came up close to me ; when I felt a sudden shock , at the sight of him - He seemed to be a son of Mr. W - 's ; he had every feature of his face - I started and trembled - however , I soon recovered myself , concluding that such an idea must be owing merely to the strong impression which his countenance had made on my mind , at our <page type="Page 179"/> last interview , and which a terrified immagination might possibly have transferred a likeness of , to any object viewed in the uncertain light of a just opening dawn - I therefore embraced the lovely child , and walked away with him , leaning on the servant 's arm , who was then come up , to a neat cottage , which was but a few yards from the spot I had been found in .
</p>
<p>
I was received at the door of the house , by a lady of a genteeler appearance than one could naturally expect to have met with , under so mean a roof , who with a voice of sweetness welcomed me to what hospitality her circumstances could afford , and taking me by the hand , led me into her best apartment - I sat down on the first chair I could reach , <page type="Page 180"/> and begged for a glass of water , to prevent my fainting , which I apprehended , from my feelings , might probably soon happen .
</p>
<p>
The room we were in was soon lighted up with fire and candles , the blaze of which offended my tender sight , already dimmed by the darkness of the foregoing night , and weakened by my tears , which prevented me from being able to view objects distinctly enough , at first ; but when the agitation of my spirits had been somewhat abated , and that my eyes had recovered their strength a little , I perceived the lady to be a person of about four and twenty years of age , and extremely handsome , but seeming much impaired in her appearance , by grief , or sickness .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 181"/> Here I began to shudder again ; for the resemblance between her and Mr. W - , struck me more forcibly than it had done before , in the child - There could be no equivocation , in this instance - her features marked the likeness stronger , and the clear light , I had then an opportunity of viewing her by , put the similitude beyond a doubt - This mystery alarmed me - I feared I had fallen into dangerous hands ; but it would have been doubly improper to have asked for a solution of this riddle , on account either of the seeming to pry into her secret , or the hazard of betraying my own .
</p>
<p>
I therefore concealed my surprise , though I could not avoid shewing my uneasiness ; which she perceiving , but <page type="Page 182"/> without suspecting the cause , and imputing solely to my misfortunes and fatigue , which she seemed to think were sufferings I had not been much accustomed to , intreated me to repose myself on the bed that was in the chamber , as long as I pleased , without fear of interruption , till I should be inclined to accept of any other kind of comfort or refreshment , that might be within the compass of her poor means to afford me .
</p>
<p>
The voice of kindness to an oppressed heart , at once soothes , and gives vent to its sufferings .
I answered only with my tears ; she rose , and taking her child by the hand , said that she was too well acquainted with sorrow to attempt to restrain its course , or think it capable of any other relief , than time and prayer ; <page type="Page 183"/> adding , that I need be under no manner of apprehension that any curiosity of her 's should prompt her to inquire into my story , as the measure of her own misfortunes was too full already to admit the addition of another 's grief , without the power of alleviating it .
She retired immediately without waiting for a reply .
</p>
<p>
Being now sheltered from all outward ills and violences , the distraction of my mind began to feel itself under the less controul ; despair and phrenzy now triumphed over my reason and religion ; I looked about for some instrument of destruction , to put an end to my miserable existence , and snatching at a sword that hung unsheathed over the chimney , I had just set the hilt of it to the ground , <page type="Page 182"/> [ ... ] <page type="Page 183"/> [ ... ] <page type="Page 184"/> when my guardian hostess , attentive to my motions , running into the room to see what had occasioned my disturbance , had just time enough to strike the point aside , so that I fell unhurt upon the floor .
-
</p>
<p>
' `` O stop the hand of rashness !
she exclaimed , nor dare to limit mercy !
He who severely tries , as amply can reward the patient sufferer ; let thy proud heart bow to his high decrees , and learn to bear thy burthen with submission . '' '
</p>
<p>
While thus she spoke , I gazed upon her with a silent awe , and thought her more than human - She raised me from the ground , with looks of tenderness , and thus proceeded - ' `` That sorrow has <page type="Page 185"/> beset , and has subdued you , I can well perceive - Alas !
what is your strength or mine , opposed to its rude grasp !
But wherefore then should we rely upon ourselves , when offered aid bends from high heaven for our acceptance , and bids our weak humanity be strong in its almighty power ! '' '
</p>
<p>
I sunk again upon my knees before her , and cried out , ' `` I have no hope in heaven or earth !
Thou messenger of grace , thy proffered aid is vain !
I am an out-cast from society , nor would even your charity extend itself to such a wretch as me , were you to know my crimes . '' '
</p>
<p>
' `` I will not hear them then , she answered quick , but sure there is no guilt , except <page type="Page 186"/> despair , that may not hope for pardon - Remove that gloomy vice from your sad heart , and penitence shall heal the wounds of your offenc [ ... ] , and bid your bleeding bosom be at peace . '' '
</p>
<p>
By slow degrees this more than woman , this heaven-instructed comforter , calmed my distracted soul , and reasoned down my frenzy - I passed my word to her not to attempt my life , and I have kept it ; have waited till the lingering , though sure bane of human health , unceasing sorrow , shall release my promise , and lay me gently in the silent grave .
</p>
<p>
As soon as my mind had become somewhat more composed , I began to reflect upon the circumstances of my late misfortune <page type="Page 187"/> - I thought with horror on the impiety [ ... ] neglecting a duty toward the manes , of the unhappy sacrifice of my wayward destiny ; I felt like an accomplice in the guilt , if I should not endeavour to rescue the remains of that dear and unfortunate object , from the still continued barbarity of his murderer , and attempt to procure it the rites of christian , at least of human , sepulture .
</p>
<p>
The idea that first occured to me , upon this occasion , was to fly off directly to the inn at Hart [ ... ] nd , to Captain R - , for Sir Thomas had told me that his friend and confident had accompanied him now , as before - and to have acqu [ ... ] inted him with the fatal catastrophé of my story - But how to appear before a <page type="Page 188"/> stranger , or indeed any person whatsoever , under the sensation of [ ... ] onscious guilt , and public infamy !
Besides , mig [ ... ] I not happen to be detected there , and possibly have involved a third person in my complicated misfortune !
However , I contrived to qualify these scruples , by the subterfuge of writing a note to him , containing only these few words .
</p>
<p>
' `` Your friend is , alas , no more !
he lies murdered at Castle W - .
I do not mean by this notice to call even for justice against his assassin , but only hope that your humanity and friendship may be able to defend his hapless corse from any further indignity or outrage . '' '
</p>
<p>
To this billet I did not subscribe any name , but got my kind hostess to send <page type="Page 189"/> it off immediately to the inn , by one of the villagers , who was instructed not to say from whence he came , nor to await an answer .
</p>
<p>
This most excellent woman , so far from desiring to dive into the secret of my distress , made it a point rather , that I should not reveal it , whenever she heard me begin to mourn ; but in order , as she said , to convince me that mine was not a partial lot , and that she had herself severely tasted of the bitter cup , she would relate some of those very uncommon misfortunes which had attended her through life , and which might , perhaps , in some measure , reconcile me to my own .
</p>
<p>
But first she insisted that I should endeavour to recruit my strength and <page type="Page 190"/> spirits with food and rest , as the preserving the proper temperament of the body , was certainly one requisite towards restoring the health of the mind - I accepted her hospitality , and breakfasted on tea , but could not eat - She did not press me - She was reasonable in all things ; entreaty , in my situation , would have but added to my fatigue , and increased my disgust .
She thought that sleep might , for a time , better supply the place of food ; she therefore obliged me to undress myself and go into bed ; where after having closed the windows , as it was now full day , and removed every implement of mischief out of the room , she left me to repose myself - if possible .
</p>
<p>
I did what I could , for that purpose - I owed that duty to the infant yet unborn , <page type="Page 191"/> and was solicitous to preserve that part of myself , at least , that was innocent .
But my sorrows kept me long awake , till nature , taking advantage of my weakness , at length delivered my body over to sleep , though without composing my mind ; for my disturbed imagination pursued me still throughout my slumber , presenting visions of slaughter , gibbets , and executions , to my tortured fancy , all the while ; which instead of yielding me any manner of refreshment , by frequent starts awoke me ; adding the pains of labour to my other ills , which brought on a miscarriage , towards the evening .
</p>
<p>
My humane hostess attended on me with the kindness and tenderness of a sister , supplied me with cordials , kept every thing quiet about me , and would <page type="Page 192"/> sit up all night , by my bed-side , notwithstanding every opposition I could make to it .
The next morning she prevailed on me to take some sustenance , after which I claimed her promise of letting me into the history of her life ; which however , I did not do to satisfy an idle curiosity , but thought that the circumstances of her recital , might perhaps amuse my mind from too fixed an attention to my own sorrows , and that the gentle murmurs of her voice , with the monotony of narrative , might possibly have conduced to slumber .
</p>
<p>
But judge of my amazement when she began by telling me that she was the daughter , the only child of Mr. W - !
I was near betraying myself - I could not conceal my surprise , but cried out , ' `` It <page type="Page 193"/> is impossible !
you can not be his offspring ! '' '
She calmly answered , ' `` You know him then ; '' ' and without inquiring further , thus proceeded .

<p>
But as the unhappy Maria is come now to a pause in her misfortunes , let us , my dear sister , take this opportunity of resting a little ourselves , after the fatigue and horror of her story , before we enter upon an other .
I confess , that when I came to this part of it , I rejoiced to think she was dead ?
my humanity felt less from the reflection that her sufferings were at an end .
As we are affected more by the distress we see , than by what we only hear of , so is our compassion always <page type="Page 194"/> stronger for the living sorrow , than the dead one - Yet one must still weep for Hecuba .
</p>
<p>
The wind is become fair for this narrative , but my anxiety has been increased at not hearing from you before it changed .
</p>
<p>
Adieu ,
</p>
<p>
F. CLEVELAND .
</p>
<p>
THE following episode of the fair Cottager , though short , will be some relief to us both , before we proceed to the catastrophe of the main action , and conclude the History of the unfortunate Maria , whose peculiar fate suffered <page type="Page 195"/> not her indignities to terminate with her life , but afterwards delivered over her corse into the clutches of the brute Colville , to be carried in the procession of a mock funeral , at Amiens .
</p>
<p>
The STORY of Mrs. N - .
</p>
<p>
My mother was the only child of Captain H - , a younger brother of a distinguished family ; her ill fortune brought her acquainted , very young , with Mr. W - , while he was a student at Oxford , and under age - They saw , liked , and wedded , without the consent of parents on either side - Captain H - was afterwards made acquainted with the marriage , but died before my other grandfather , from whom it was thought prudent to keep it still a secret , as my dear mother inherited but a very inconsiderable <page type="Page 196"/> portion .
This was made a pretence for keeping their union concealed , during the life of his father ; and my mother , who tenderly loved her husband , consented to let their connection still wear the veil of mystery , rather than injure his interest , or offend his father .
</p>
<p>
The doubtfulness of her situation by degrees detached her own friends intirely from her , and , for some years before the death of his father , she lived in perfect solitude , hardly ever seeing any person but her husband and me , her only child , who were the sole objects of her care and affection .
</p>
<p>
I was about seven years old when my grandfather W - died , and I am <page type="Page 197"/> persuaded that if my mother felt any joy upon that occasion , it was for my sake only , as she wished to have my legitimacy acknowledged , and my education properly attended to - A long habit of retirement had weaned her from the world , and though of an age to relish all its pleasures , being then but four and twenty , she thought of returning into it rather with disgust than delight .
</p>
<p>
Upon various pretences my father declined owning his marriage , for about two years , and the gentleness of my mother 's temper prevented her from importuning him , on this or any subject ; but when so long an interval had elapsed , since his father 's death , and that she perceived a visible alteration in his behaviour <page type="Page 198"/> towards her , she with the utmost mildness expressed her wishes to live with him publicly as his wife - He strove for near a year more , to evade her request ; but when her apprehensions began to be alarmed by his conduct , and that she ventured so far as to press him on the subject , he slew into a rage , and utterly denied his having ever been married to her .
</p>
<p>
Tears and prayers were all the weapons with with she attempted to assert her rights - They had , alas !
no power on his obdurate heart - Grief preyed upon her tender frame , and when I had just entered my tenth year , she fell into a consumption - she was sensible of her approaching fate , and though she had remitted her own claim to my father 's <page type="Page 199"/> rank or fortune , she determined not to leave me in the power of a man who had abandoned her to unmerited infamy , but immediately to set about proving her marriage , and by that means entitling me both to his name , and a proper provision from his fortune .
</p>
<p>
She soon found out that Doctor N - , the clergyman who had married her , lived in the parish of - , in this shire ; and that my grandfather , old Mr. W - , had presented him to that living , which was incumbent on some part of my father 's estate - She took me with her , and set out immediately for his house ; which expedition she could easily make without her husband 's knowledge , as they had seldom lived under the same roof together for some time past .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 200"/> It is impossible to express this worthy man 's surprise at the sight of my mother and me , as my father had informed him that she was dead above three years before , left no child , and earnestly requested him never to mention his having been married to her , as it could answer no end to her then , would certainly disoblige some of his relations , through whose assistance , he said , he had conceived reasonable hopes of strengthening his interest in the shire , and of improving his fortune .
</p>
<p>
As soon as my mother had acquainted him with her story , the good old man promised her to pay a visit , the next day , to my father , who had been his pupil at the university , and endeavour to influence him , by gentle means , to <page type="Page 201"/> do her the justice he owed her , rather than reduce her to the irksome necessity of exposing him and herself , by an appeal to some higher and more legal tribunal ; assuring her , at the same time , that if his mediation should not be attended with that success which he wished , and had reason to expect from it , he would no longer hesitate a moment about proving the marriage , through all the forms of law .
</p>
<p>
My dear unhappy mother wept and thanked him , and the doctor , according to his promise , proceeded the next day to Castle W - , which is about ten miles from this village , being the mansion seat where my father then resided .
It happened that he was from home , at the time the doctor went to his house ; <page type="Page 202"/> and in the fullness of his zeal , he wrote him an admonitory letter upon this interesting subject , and returned much disappointed at not having seen him .
</p>
<p>
In a few days after this event , my father came to doctor N - 's , and endeavoured to make my mother 's mind easy upon the equivocal appearances of his conduct towards her , imputing it all to the prudential reasons he had before mentioned to the doctor , in which he said that the future welfare of herself and family were equally interested ; adding , that their living together in England could not be long concealed , but that he was ready to retire with her to any part of Flanders , upon pretence of his going to travel for a few years , till the schemes he had in agitation might be <page type="Page 203"/> brought to bear , when they might return home again and enjoy the remainder of their lives in happiness and honour together .
</p>
<p>
My dear mother , as was natural to an unsuspecting and ingenuous mind , was fondly amused with this artifice , and wept with transport , at his mock professions ; the doctor too blessed his pupil , with tears of joy , and my father returned back to Castle W - , the next day , in order to prepare every thing necessary towards our departure for the continent , without any further delay .
</p>
<p>
But this delusion did not long continue , for the morning after he had left us , Mr. N - , a young ensign , and nephew to Doctor N - , happened to <page type="Page 204"/> come from Exeter , where he was then stationed , to pay a visit to his uncle ; and among other articles of news , told him that his landlord and patron , as he stiled my father , was soon to be married to a young lady of family and fortune , in the city he came from , and that he supposed the doctor would be then called upon to perform the ceremony .
</p>
<p>
The young man had never heard any thing of our story , and only mentioned this particular among some other indifferent circumstances of the time - His uncle did not open his mind to him upon the subject , but retired immediately to my mother 's apartment , who happened luckily not to be by when this matter was related , and after endeavouring to prepare her as much as <page type="Page 205"/> possible for the shock , acquainted her with the intelligence he had just received .
</p>
<p>
To you , dear Madam , who seem to have known affliction , it must be needless to describe the emotions of my unhappy mother , upon this occasion - The humane doctor N - said every thing he could think of , to asswage her distraction , and repeated the promise he had made her before , of concurring with her in an immediate vindication of her rights , seeing there was now no time to lose , and that it was sufficiently apparent Mr. W - meant to take advantage of her too long acquiescence under the concealment of her marriage , and , by this new and more public engagement , to bar her claim forever .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 206"/> He confessed , that notwithstanding his plausible professions to them both , at parting , his mind could not help still harbouring some doubts with regard to the sincerity of them - For however , said he , my christianity may incline me to a perfect faith in the efficacy of divine grace , one is naturally apt to suspect your extempore converts , especially where the reformation seems , as in this case , to have been brought about by the necessity of some present urgency .
</p>
<p>
He concluded then , that my father 's scheme , in carrying my mother and me out of the kingdom , must be to separate us from the advice or assistance of whatever friends we might have here , and that being bereft of the protection of English laws , he meant to shut us up <page type="Page 207"/> in a convent together , for life , upon some forged pretence or other ; which would leave him at liberty to return in triumph home again , and complete his base purpose with his new mistress at Exeter .
</p>
<p>
That very day doctor N - gave my mother a regular certificate of her marriage , signed by himself , as the clergyman who had performed the ceremony , referring to the page of the parish registry , where that transaction was entered ; at the bottom of which he put a memorandum of the names of the two witnesses who were present , one of which is still alive , if that were an article of any manner of consequence to me now .
</p>
<p>
The next day my father came to the house , with a carriage to convey us off <page type="Page 208"/> privately , through the country , to Weymouth , where he told us he had prepared a ship to sail over directly to the continent .
My mother made no reply , but wept , and quitted the room , to leave Dr. N - at liberty to explain the reason of her silence and sorrow .
</p>
<p>
Their conversation was warm , but short - The doctor made remonstrances to him upon his behaviour , both from religion , morals , and the laws ; which my father resented with the highest intemperance , declaring that he had happily one way still left , to screen himself from persecution and prosecution both , and then rushed out of the house ; which expression was , soon after , more fully explained , by hearing that he had gone off to France , whither no legal process could pursue him ,
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 209"/> These transactions were kept a perfect secret from me for several years - My fond mother thought it too soon for me to become acquainted with affliction , and our worthy protector had also conceived a certain delicate idea , about me , with regard to vice - His opinion was certainly just , that the longer young people are kept ignorant of it , the safer for their morals - Purity of thought , and innocence of action , should be suffered to gain strength by habit , before they know that there is such a thing as wickedness in human nature - The shock and abhorrence will be the greater on the first instance , and the danger of example less .
</p>
<p>
Doctor N - kept us with him , and supported us out of his own fortune , while my poor mother lived , or rather <page type="Page 210"/> languished , which she did for about two years , and then expired of a broken heart .
The doctor was so generous as to make her last moments easy , by promising to take care of me , till he could force my father , by law , to make a provision for me , as his legitimate child ; saying , that he thought it his duty to pay the debt of gratitude he owed to my grandfather , to the only part of his family now that deserved it .
</p>
<p>
My father 's emissaries soon informed him of my mother 's death , and he returned to his seat , a joyful widower - The doctor immediately applied to him on my behalf , but so far from being softened by his intercession , he loaded him with abuse , and threatened him with ruin if he did not instantly consent to <page type="Page 211"/> my being sent to a convent abroad , and solemnly swear never to mention his marriage with my mother , nor again interfere in his domestic affairs , upon any occasion or pretence .
What became of his Exeter amour , I know not , having never heard a word about it , since .
</p>
<p>
Faithful to his promise , the doctor refused to give him the satisfaction he required , nor would he consent to my going into a convent , upon any terms .
Conscious of the purity of his life and actions , he disregarded my father 's threats , and continued to treat me with the same kindness as if I had been his daughter .
</p>
<p>
My Father , who was lord of the manor , stirred up most of the doctor 's parishioners to non-payment of tithes , and <page type="Page 212"/> supported them in every kind of insolence and injustice against him .
This excellent divine , who was really a believer and follower of the doctrine which he taught , suffered those who had taken his cloak to take his coat also , and having no activity in him , but for others , in a very short time was deprived of the means of support , either for himself or family - But why should I dwell longer on those miseries , of which I was the unhappy , though innocent cause !
</p>
<p>
This best of men breathed his last sigh in a prison , about three years after my mother 's death , and must latterly have wanted even the common necessaries of life , but for the duty and affection of his nephew , who was now become a captain , and more than shared his little income <page type="Page 213"/> with him and me , who , from the time that my dear guardian was thrown into confinement , had been placed by him to board and lodge with the wife of his parish-clerk .
</p>
<p>
During all the sufferings of this true divine , he was never prompted to revile the cruel author of them ; nor to repine at the wretched state to which he was reduced ; and even to his last moments comforted and exhorted both me , and his fellow prisoners , to bear their crosses with resignation , with chearfulness , and with forgiveness to their persecutors and oppressors .
</p>
<p>
While the doctor was able to keep house , captain N - used often to visit there , and stay sometimes whole <page type="Page 214"/> months together , with us ; and after his uncle 's misfortune , which separated us , he came frequently to see me , at my new lodgings .
He was a very worthy agreeable young man , we had insensibly conceived a liking for each other , and just before his uncle 's death , he asked his consent to offer his hand and heart to me .
</p>
<p>
The good man confessed himself much pleased at this overture , and upon mentioning it to me , said , that when I should no longer have a protector in him , I must be either thrown upon the world , to get my bread in a state of servitude , which he thought both dangerous , and improper for me , or obliged to sue to my father for a support , which he feared he would refuse , unless he were to confine me in a convent , which he most earnestly <page type="Page 215"/> entreated me not to consent to , but to persevere in suffering for the faith wherein I had been bred .
</p>
<p>
And with regard to his nephew , he paid me the compliment to think I was capable of rendering him happy , and that eventually I might turn out a good fortune to him , either by my father 's death , or reformation .
I received the proposal , I confess , with pleasure , and readily pronounced that consent with my lips , which my heart had given before - My more than father !
my guardian !
my protector !
now saw his desire accomplished in our union - With his dying hands he joined ours , and then slept in peace .
</p>
<p>
For three whole years I was the happiest of human kind ; my husband was <page type="Page 216"/> all that my fondest wishes could have framed ; that child you saw , was his delight and mine ; no frown e'er clouded either of our brows , or slightest contradiction passed our lips : I was - I was too blest !
till heaven reclaimed its best its dearest gift , and took him early , to reward his virtues .
</p>
<p>
Tho ' bred with such a shining pattern as doctor N - before me , and long nurtured as I had been , in the school of adversity , yet this trial was too much for my weak mind , which sunk oppressed into lethargic woe - The voice of reason is not heard by grief , religion only reaches the sad heart - Cheered by the boundless hope of passing an eternity of bliss with him I now lamented , I raised my drooping eye lids from the <page type="Page 217"/> grave , and turned my views to heaven , implored its grace to bend my stubborn soul , to its high will , and soothe my warring passions to submission - My prayer was heard ; no murmurs , no complainings , from that pious moment of reflection , have issued from my lips ; in humble confidence , without impatience , I wait for my dismission from this vale of sorrow .
</p>
<p>
Yet let me own that were there not a weight thrown in that scale that ties me down to earth , my resignation would have had more merit .
My dear , my much loved boy , abates my ardor for the land of bliss , and makes me fear that while his fate is doubtful , I should even shudder on the brink of my long wished-for voyage .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 218"/> In a heart rightly formed there can not be a void - Maternal fondness now fills the place of chaste connubial love , and in this soft exercise of my affections , no griefs distract , no transports rend my soul .
</p>
<p>
This place I live in , is a freehold that Captain H - , my grandfather had purchased , soon after I was born , for the term of three lives ; his own , my mother 's , and mine - His wife had been dead , some years before .
It consists of this cottage , a small plough-land , a close for pasture , and a little garden ; at an inconsiderable rent - Here I have lived all my life , except while I was sheltered under the protection of the good doctor N - ; during which interval the farm was let to a tenant at will , till I was married , when my dear husband and I came to <page type="Page 219"/> reside here , as much as his military duty would permit ; and here he left me , when he was ordered with the regiment abroad , last war ; in the first campaign of which he was killed .
</p>
<p>
The produce of this small demesne , with my pension as a Captain 's widow , is all I have to maintain my child and me , and require the closest attention and oeconomy to render them sufficient - And even these pittances depend upon the precarious tenure of my life - but I will not doubt the goodness of Providence , and trust it will raise him up a support , when it shall think proper to withdraw mine .
</p>
<p>
Now judge , unhappy stranger , she continued , if I have not a right to speak of <page type="Page 220"/> patience , of resignation and religion , as the surest balm of sorrow !
Philosophy and faith concur in this , there is a hope beyond the grave , and nought but vice , unatoned by penitence and piety , need ever urge despair !
</p>
<p>

<p>
I had hung with mute attention on her story , my tears had flowed with her 's , and while she spoke , her griefs suspended mine ; admiration of her virtue now succeeded , and kept me silent still , but there , alas !
our sympathy must end , she might rejoice in her afflictions past , whilst I must mourn for ever !
</p>
<p>
I passed six days with this uncanonized saint , this living Patience , of whom <page type="Page 221"/> Shakespear 's image was but a prototype * .
She knew me not , all the while , and I could not reveal myself , nor had the particulars of my sad story yet reached her incurious ears , to have given her the least cause of suspecting who I was .
</p>
<p>
By various methods , and slow degrees , I pursued my journey towards Flintshire .
As I drew nearer to my mother 's peaceful cottage , I anticipated the misery and horror she would feel , when she should know my situation , and considered myself as a wretch who was going to communicate an incurable disease , to the fond bosom that had nursed and cherished it - Prophetic were my thoughts !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 222"/> The first emotions she felt on seeing me , were those of love and joy ; she strained me to her honest breast , with true maternal tenderness , and exclaimed , ' `` Mr. W - has at last relented , and blessed me with a sight of my Maria ! '' '
Whilst I , o'erwhelmed with her unmerited kindness , sunk speechless to the earth - Tears were the sole return that I could make to her caresses and inquiries .
</p>
<p>
My mother was alarmed ; ' `` Sorrow , she said , my child , we both have known , but sure that should not seal your lips to those who wish to share and soothe your griefs , or render you insensible to love like mine . '' '
</p>
<p>
I grasped her honoured hand , pressed it to my heart , and vainly strove to articulate a sound - For several hours I remained <page type="Page 223"/> in this situation - At length my speech returned , and throwing myself on my knees before her , I could not be prevailed on to forsake that posture , till I had recounted to her the whole of that horrid tale , which you have just now read .
</p>
<p>
I will not wound your heart , my brother , with attempting to describe the agonies she suffered , during the sad recital of my story , yet this truly virtuous , this scarce erring woman , pitied the crimes which she herself detested , and spoke of peace and pardon to my afflicted soul !
even to the latest moment of her life - for she is dead !
- She strove to hide her anguish , and to lessen mine .
</p>
<p>
The night I got there , after I had been in bed , and just falling into a slumber , <page type="Page 224"/> from the fatigue of my journey and the waste of my spirits , I was alarmed by the noise of some persons , who knocked loudly at the door of the house , and demanded admittance - The people with whom we lodged refused them entrance , unless they would first declare the purpose of their errand - This they refused , but sending for a sledge , soon battered down all opposition , and rushed in .
</p>
<p>
My mother and I had but just time to hurry on our cloaths , when an ill looking fellow , with a candle in one hand , and a pistol in the other , came into our chamber , attended by two other ruffians .
- Upon their appearance we instantly offered to surrender all our effects , and promised neither to make resistance nor pursuit .
They seemed highly to resent <page type="Page 225"/> our manner of reception , and replied , that they scorned to use any manner of violence that might not be justified by the law .
</p>
<p>
The principal of the men then told me that he was steward to Mr. W - , and had been dispatched by him with a warrant to apprehend me , for the murder of Sir Thomas L - , early the next morning after the fact , and my flight for the same , with directions to come and look for me in that place , as it was natural to suppose that I should have flown to my mother for refuge , after my crime - He said that he had examined and inquired for me , all along the road , and had concealed his business in that village , for several days , lying in wait for my arrival .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 226"/> Horror and amazement seized both my unhappy mother and me - I pitied her more than myself - I was hardened to sufferings , I wished to die , though not with ignominy , and felt disappointed at finding the purpose of these housebreakers had ended with so little violence to my life - I apprehended no danger from the prosecution ; but to think of an arraignment and a public trial , was distraction !
I reflected deeply on the divine and sustaining sentiments of the amiable Mrs. N - , and her precepts and example had a salutary effect on my mind .
</p>
<p>
The steward then returned to the inn , to send off to Chester for a chaise to carry me to Exeter , the county town of Devonshire , to take my trial at the next <page type="Page 227"/> assizes , which were immediately to be held there ; but left his two guards in the house , to prevent my escape - My afflicted mother , who had fallen upon the bed when she heard the shocking sentence pronounced , lay silent for a minute , then turning to me , who was standing speechless , and motionless , before her , with a look of wildness and despair , cried out , ' `` I 'll go with you , I 'll die with you , we never shall be parted more . '' '
I threw myself down by her , we embraced and lay folded in each other 's arms , till we were summoned , the next morning , to begin our journey .
</p>
<p>
We travelled with all the expedition that our conductors were pleased to make , and suffered every indignity and insolence of office , all the way , that mean <page type="Page 228"/> persons are apt to inflict on those above them , whenever they happen to gain an authority over them .
- All this I felt not but as I sympathized with my unhappy mother , for as to myself I welcomed every mortification and distress I met with , and even wished them still more severe .
</p>
<p>
We were at length relieved from this oppression by arriving at Exeter , where we were carried directly to the sheriff 's house , and delivered over into his custody ; for my dear mother would not quit me , but said that the same prison , or the same grave , should receive us both - This humane person behaved with the utmost tenderness and politeness toward us , offered us every refreshment and accommodation that his hospitality <page type="Page 229"/> could afford , and told me that he would impose no other restraint on me than an earnest request that I would accept of the best apartment in his house , and prevail on my mother to share the same comforts and conveniences with me - He then bowed and retired .
</p>
<p>
He returned soon after , to introduce a gentleman to us , who he said had some affair of business to communicate to me , and then withdrew again .
But how was I overwhelmed with confusion , when the person announced his name to be Captain R - !
The confidant of my shame , stood before me - My trial was began , already - I felt as if I was at the bar .
</p>
<p>
This gentleman behaved with great good-breeding and compassion to me , on <page type="Page 230"/> that occasion ; he scarcely looked at me , but going up directly to my mother , whom he saw in tears , assured her that she need not suffer the least uneasiness on account of her daughter , as he had already made her innocence appear so fully to the Justice , that she was not to be arraigned , on the trial , and might now consider herself perfectly free from her arrest .
- He prevented us , he would not listen to our acknowledgments , but directing his discourse to me , though without turning his eyes towards me , thus proceeded .
</p>
<p>
' `` In order to make you acquainted with the present situation of this unhappy business , it is necessary for me , Madam , to recount the regular process of it , from the moment I had <page type="Page 231"/> been informed of the event , by an anonymous billet , to this time .
I soon guessed the writer , and as quickly suspected the author of the tragedy - Upon these hints , I immediately applied to a magistrate in the neighbourhood , and after having given in my depositions , according to the notice I had received , I became armed with proper force and authority , and rode directly to Castle W - . '
</p>
<p>
' `` I was not denied admission , and upon opening my commission , Mr. W - charged you , Madam , directly with the fact ; said you had absconded immediately after the murder , and that he had just then issued a warrant , and dispatched a pursuit after you , in order to have you apprehended and <page type="Page 232"/> delivered over into the hands of justice - Then , by way of supporting his assertion by circumstances , led me up stairs into the room where the corpse lay extended on the ground , shewed me the discharged pistol lying on the bed , and pointed to the blood , with which the coverlet had been stained in many places . '
</p>
<p>
' `` I wept over the body of my dear friend , '' ' said he , ' `` then turning to Mr. W - , shewed him the note I had received , and asked him if he knew the hand ?
Yes ( he replied quick ) it is my wife 's , and one line in it I think sufficiently certifies against her - I do not mean by this notice to call even for justice against his assassin .
Whose danger , I pray you , do you imagine she should be so tender of ?
Would <page type="Page 233"/> she not have named the assassin , if that might have been done , with safety to herself ? '
</p>
<p>
' `` Sir , I replied , you will now give me leave to reason upon the circumstances relative to this melancholy affair , in turn .
It can not be difficult , considering the several parties , both separately and connected , to suppose the motive of Sir Thomas 's errand hither ; and whether it were most natural for the fond mistress , or the jealous husband , to have been the murderer , is a question sitter to be argued in a court , than discussed here .
For which reason , ( concluded I ) I shall pretend to act but ministerially upon this occasion , and therefore I do now , in the name of justice , arrest you and your whole houshold , in <page type="Page 234"/> order to take your trials , jointly and severally , for this murder . '
</p>
<p>
' `` Mr. W - seemed startled at this discourse , but talked highly , and began to put himself into a posture of defence ; upon which I presented a pistol to his breast , and pointing to the mangled corpse , cried , There , Sir , is your example , should you attempt to resist .
He then surrendered himself a prisoner , the rest of his family did the same ; and after I had got the body laid with decency on the bed , left the servants of the deceased to attend it , and given charge of the funeral to the clergyman of the parish , I escorted my captives to the goal in this city , where they have remained ever since . '
</p>
<p>
' `` Upon their examination before a magistrate in this town , ( continued he ) the <page type="Page 235"/> maid servant , who said she had attended on you , Madam , turned evidence , to save her life , and charged her master with the murder .
She said that he had come to the house , in the evening , privately , and desired her to conceal his arrival from her mistress .
That he told her there was an assignation fixed for that night , between Sir Thomas L - and his wife ; and about the time that he thought they might have put out the candles , he took her with him to the room , to be a witness of what he said would intitle him to a divorce ; but that being disappointed in that circumstance , and alarmed at seeing Sir Thomas putting his hand to his sword , he discharged the pistol , and killed him on the spot . '
</p>
<p>
' `` Mr. W - did not make any manner of interruption or reply to this woman 's <page type="Page 236"/> deposition , while it was going on , saying only , after it was over , that he thought himself sufficiently justified in the action , both from law and conscience ; and that justice without favour , was all he should desire , to indemnify him on the day of trial . '
</p>
<p>
' `` Thus situated is this unhappy affair at present ; and with regard to your arrest , Madam , I have had that superseded already , before you arrived in town , as the warrant was only founded on surmise ; and I have myself given bail for your appearance on the trial , just to corroborate the servant maid 's testimony . '' '
</p>
<p>
I had hitherto lain reclined on my arm , hiding my face , tears , and blushes , <page type="Page 237"/> with my hand ; but when he came to the last expression , I forgot all reserve , and starting up , ' `` No , sir , said I , it can not , shall not be - I will never appear in evidence against Mr. W - : you may drag me before the court , but no violence shall make me speak there .
Justice I acknowledge to be a duty , but there are situations which may exempt one from the observance of it .
Duties can not contradict duties , and I have already too far erred against mine to him , to think of adding a further injury - And if my death is to be the consequence of my silence , I am willing to pay that forfeit , to redeem his . '' '
</p>
<p>
Captain R - seemed struck with my sentiments on so difficult an occasion , and told me that he would consult his <page type="Page 238"/> lawyers that night , whether my evidence might be dispensed with ; and would wait on me again , the next morning - He then took his leave , and left my poor mother and me to pass an anxious , sleepless night , in mourning the distress of our present situation .
</p>
<p>
The next day he came to us , and said that his counsel had told him , that as he was the prosecutor , he might excuse whatever witness he pleased , especially as the servant maid 's testimony was full enough to the point already - We thanked him extremely for his humanity and politeness , and the instant he retired we hired a chaise , and drove out of the town , on our road back to Flintshire , flying as fast as possible from a scene of so much horror .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 239"/> The anxiety of mind and fatigue of body which my dear mother had laboured under , all this while , had brought on a fever that confined her in bed , from the moment we reached her habitation in Flintshire .
I wept , prayed , and attended on her , during her illness , till her last moment - She blessed her children - even me she blessed , and prayed for peace and pardon to my polluted soul !
she expired in my fainting arms - leaveing me friendless , in a world alone !
</p>
<p>
But fate had not yet done with me !
I was not yet unhappy enough !
About two days after her death , I received a letter from Captain R - , who had found out the place of my residence , from Mr. W - 's steward , which brought me the following account from Exeter .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 240"/> ' `` The facts and arguments upon which Mr. W - grounded his defence , were these - When Mrs. W - had given her letter for Sir Thomas to the messenger , he mentioned it to the gardener , and he communicated his intelligence to her maid , who had been appointed a spy over all her actions - She took it from the man , inclosed it to her master , and sent him off directly with it to London . '
</p>
<p>
' `` As soon as he received it , he broke it open , and took a copy , which he made his own man compare , and witness , then sealed and sent off the original to Sir Thomas , by a special messenger , who pretended he had come from Castle W - , not caring to intrust the fellow who had brought it , lest he <page type="Page 241"/> should have betrayed him , as he had before deceived Mrs. W - .
The answer he proceeded with in the same manner , and then dispatched the first carrier with it to Mrs W - . '
</p>
<p>
' `` This state of the case Mr. W - had sent up to London , along with the attested copies of the letters , for the opinion of an eminent counsel , to know whether , upon such a certainty of the fact , and finding the adulterer in such an improper situation with his wife , the laws did not grant some indulgence to the transports and resentment of a provoked and injured husband ? '
</p>
<p>
' `` The lawyer 's reply was , that such considerations had , indeed , been sometimes permitted to be laid before a <page type="Page 242"/> jury , in alleviation of the crime he had been guilty of , but that it was only in cases where no premeditation had appeared in the matter : and that his was a very different situation , as he had confessed his having been apprised of the assignation , assisted in forwarding the appointment , and had travelled above an hundred miles , with a malice praepense to take Sir Thomas L - at an unfair advantage .
From all which circumstances he concluded that the laws would not consider him as a provoked husband , but a deliberate assassin . '
</p>
<p>
' `` This answer deprived him of all hope , and drove him to distraction - Could the articles mentioned in the state of his case have been prevented <page type="Page 243"/> from coming before the court , he might , perhaps , have had some chance of escaping , but the messenger of the two letters was among the persons that had been taken up for the murder , had made a deposition in his own defence , and was to be produced on the trial .
This particular confirmed his despair , and in a transport of madness the unhappy man put an end to his life , in the prison , the day before the assizes began . '' '
</p>
<p>
Prepared though I was to expect an account of Mr. W - 's death , the manner of it , however , filled my soul with horror , and had a more immediate effect upon my constitution , than any of the shocks I had received before .
From that sad hour , when no kind prop <page type="Page 244"/> remained to stay my overburdened heart , I have sunk beneath its weight ; my wasting form and slackened nerves give hopes of my release , and with this heavy task , which now draws near an end , I trust my woes shall cease .
</p>
<p>
The first thing that occurred to my mind , upon this tragical event , was the benefit that my humane and hospitable friend of the cottage , and her lovely child , might possibly receive from it ; and I had the satisfaction , before I left the kingdom , to hear that Mrs. N - had sufficiently proved her mother 's marriage , by the certificate and witness , and taken possession of castle W - , as sole heiress to her father 's estate and fortune , which were very considerable .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 245"/> I did not make myself known to her , as under our different circumstances no manner of connection could ever properly have subsisted between us ; but , as I was entitled to a jointure of four hundred pounds a year , by marriage settlement , I put the deed , which had been left in my mother 's possession , into the hands of an attorney at Chester , to claim my rights , which were not denied ; and on receipt of the first payment I quitted England , for ever , and came over here to France , with a purpose of retiring immediately into a convent , for life .
</p>
<p>
I began my narrative of woe , before I left England , and have completed it since I came over , and shall put it into the India House for you , at Paris , if I <page type="Page 246"/> may have life enough to carry me thither , as I design to fix my residence in some of the distant provinces beyond it .
But I have been confined here , these two days , not being able to proceed further , from the failure of my strength , and the dejection of my spirits .
</p>
<p>
Adieu , my dearest brother !
may watchful angels hover round you , and guard and guide your footsteps in the paths of virtue !
I feel myself growing weaker , every line I write , and think that here my journey and my cares will shortly end together .
With my last sigh I pray to be forgiven by Heaven and you !
and now , once more , adieu , I hope , for ever .
</p>
<p>
MARIA .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 247"/> In answer to Letter LXII .
</p>
<p>
YES , Fanny , your remark is just - The tears which flow for foreign griefs , help somewhat to soften the poignancy of home felt sorrows .
I sympathized throughout every circumstance of the ill-fated Maria 's distress , and was rejoiced at her lucky escape from the desperate guilt of suicide .
</p>
<p>
It is intolerance not intolerability , impatience not suffering , that ever impels to such an act .
For it requires no further argument than this , that God is just , to evince that our strength of mind and body must be equally balanced by <page type="Page 248"/> nature ; so that the one may be sufficiently able to bear , whatever can be inflicted on the other , until death , without precipitation , necessarily comes to the relief of the overburdened sufferer .
For pain or grief are able to do their own business , without the assistance of a crime .
</p>
<p>
From whence I argue , that resolution may last as long as life , and that a virtuous soul may be sooner separated than subdued .
- I have endeavoured to express myself upon this subject , with all the energy I could - I feel an interest in this reasoning , at present , and shall repose my trust in it .

Maria was certainly more wretched , than I am , by the addition of one circumstance , <page type="Page 249"/> which alone was sufficient to have rendered her so ; but surely we may hope , without offence to the most rigid virtue , that penitence and sufferings , such as hers , may have atoned for her transgression , and that she now is happy - It is to be innocent , to be unhappy - Whilst I must still subscribe myself your unhappy , but affectionate sister .

In answer to letter LXI .

</p>
<p>
YOUR Fanny , my Louisa , has obeyed your kind command , and now claims the sad indulgence promised in your last - I long , yet dread to know <page type="Page 250"/> what those events can be , which you deem more interesting , than any of those extraordinary circumstances , which have already happened to you !
</p>
<p>
I can not express the mixed sensation which my heart is at present sensible of !
While I give it up to that joy , which happiness like mine should inspire , I fancy I defraud you of that portion of sorrow which is due to your distress ; and while I tenderly reflect upon your sufferings , and busy my imagination in trying to discover those additional woes you hint at , the big drop which steals down my cheek , silently reproaches me with ingratitude to my dear brother , to his amiable wife , to my reclaimed prodigal , to Providence !
and when , as it sometimes happens , my melancholy becomes <page type="Page 251"/> contagious , and that I see a gloomy look of inquiry spread over those countenances , which should be lighted up with smiles , I strive , forgive me , my Louisa !
to forget your sorrows , and dispel the cloud I have created , by affected efforts of chearfulness .
</p>
<p>
But I will no longer , like Miss Howe in Clarissa , content myself with poorly lamenting the unhappiness of my friend - I can have no doubt of Lord Hume 's indulgence , I will request his permission to see and embrace my sister - Her sighs and tears shall flow upon my bosom !
and I will try to pour the balm of comfort into her 's .
</p>
<p>
You did not date your last letter , so so that I can not even guess where you are , <page type="Page 252"/> at present ; but I shall direct this to Southfield , and impatiently wait for the explanation of that gloomy mystery in which you seem involved .
- All here salute you with the tenderest affection , for as I now consider myself accountable to lord Hume , for every moment of my time , I proclaimed my intention of writing to you , before I retired from the drawing-room ; and shall try to return to it with as chearful a countenance as I can possibly assume ; but be assured , that my heart will never be truly at ease , till I know that your 's is so - As I shall never cease to be your faithfully affectionate
</p>
<p>
friend and sister , F. HUME .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 253"/> THE knowing that my Fanny is happy , is certainly a reason for my being less wretched than when I wrote last ; but then the cruel thought of interrupting her felicity , must add to my distress - And can it bear addition !
O yes !
yes !
the torturing suspence which I now feel , too surely informs me that there yet remains many arrows in the quiver of adversity , which may still be pointed at my sad heart , and yet not pierce it through .
</p>
<p>
O Fanny , it is very difficult to die !
at least I find it so - Death sports with human misery , and would rather increase , than end them - ' '' 'T is his delight to bid <page type="Page 254"/> the wretch survive the fortunate !
the feeble wrap the athletic in his shroud , and weeping parents build their children 's tombs ! '' '
</p>
<p>
Excuse this rhapsody - I will try to collect myself , and acquaint you with the particulars of my present distress .
</p>
<p>
The morning after I had written to you , from Elm-grove , I ordered my carriage , as I had intended , and at breakfast acquainted Lady Creswell with my design of setting out for Southfield .
- Every argument that friendship or politeness could urge , were used , to prevail on me to stay with them , for a few days longer ; but I continued firm to my purpose .
</p>
<p>
I told Harriet , that she might remain with lady Creswell till she came to return <page type="Page 255"/> my visit , which both she and Sir Harry promised should be in ten days , or a fortnight - Harriet declined my indulgence , and entreated me , with uncommon earnestness , to take her with me - I considered her refusal as the effect of her attention and complaisance to me , till with a very solemn air she said to me , when we were alone , ' `` If you , Madam , think it necessary to quit Elm-grove , I am sure I ought to do so too . '' '
I acquiesced in her opinion , and desired her to get ready immediately .
</p>
<p>
Lord Lucan , to my great satisfaction , did not appear at breakfast - when he was inquired for , the servants said he had rode out , very early in the morning .
I took my friend lady Creswell aside , and requested her , not without some confusion , <page type="Page 256"/> to deliver my letter to his lordship , as soon as he returned from riding .
Almost at that instant , a servant of Sir William 's galloped into the court-yard , and presented the following billet to me .
</p>
<p>
To Lady BARTON .
</p>
<p>
The infamy of your late conduct has for some time made me balance whether I should by the bearer command your immediate return to my house , or forbid your ever entering it .
My respect for your family has so far turned the scale in your favour , as to make me , though unwillingly , condescend to receive you under my roof , till they shall be acquainted with your vileness , and either find you out a proper asylum , or join in abandoning you , with your highly injured husband ,
</p>
<p>
W. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 257"/> I have already told you that Lady Creswell was with me , when I received this shocking sentence - Amazement suspended all my powers , while I read it !
my sight forsook me , the paper dropped out of my hand , and I fell almost senseless , upon a couch !
When I recovered my speech , I bid her read it , and tell me what it meant ?
</p>
<p>
She quickly saw through the detested villainy , and at once exclaimed , ' `` your husband is abused !
that wicked Colonel Walter has deceived him - My aunt , unhappy and infatuated woman !
corresponds with him , and has doubtless transmitted an account of Lord Lucan 's being here . '' '
</p>
<p>
Her surmise was equal to conviction , and I that moment beheld myself the <page type="Page 258"/> victim of that wretch 's disappointed passion - O could my heart have told me I was an innocent one , how slightly should I have regarded the utmost malice of this fiend !
</p>
<p>
I need not attempt to describe the distraction of my mind , during the journey .
Harriet was so visibly affected with my grief , though unknowing of the cause , that I would , if possible , have concealed it from her ; and even accused myself for making her heart so early acquainted with sorrow .
</p>
<p>
When we arrived at Southfield , Benson , with tears in her eyes , informed me , that Sir William was dangerously ill ; the vein in his lungs , which had been closed , for some time , had opened , and the physician who attended him , had but <page type="Page 259"/> very faint hopes of his life - The agony which this account threw me into , I shall leave to your own sensibility to imagine - I fell upon my knees , and in an heart felt extasy , cried out , ' `` Gracious God !
have pity on me !
spare my husband 's life !
and let not his murderer triumph over him and me , at once ! '' '
</p>
<p>
Harriet and Benson raised me from the ground , with a mingled expression of pity and horror in their looks - they thought me mad - I was , alas !
too sensible , at least to misery !
- When I became a little more calm , Harriet asked me if I would not go to see Sir William ?
I started up at the question , and would have flown that moment to his bed-side , had not Benson interposed , by telling me he was just fallen into a slumber , and that the doctor had given orders he should not be disturbed .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 260"/> The idea that his mind was at rest afforded a little ease to my own ; the tears ran silent and plenteous down my cheeks , while my heart offered up the most fervent petitions to the fountain of life , for his recovery !
- By degrees I became composed , and , at Harriet 's entreaty , I tried to eat , and retired to rest .
</p>
<p>
In the morning , doctor Hartford , who attends Sir William , desired to see me - He told me that the sudden and violent return of his patient 's disorder had proceeded from some perturbation of mind , and that the only chance he had for his life , was the being kept in a state of apathy , as much as possible , and advised my not seeing him , for some days yet , as even the most pleasing emotion might be productive of fatal consequences .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 261"/> I told him I would not attempt any thing that should injure his health , though I most earnestly wished to see him .
- He said he had taken the liberty of preventing two letters from being delivered to him , for the reasons he had then given me - He presented them to me ; I saw that one of them was the letter I had sent , by the servant , the other was from Colonel Walter .
</p>
<p>
Surely , if a breach of trust could ever be deemed pardonable , the peculiarity of my situation might have furnished an excuse for reading this letter !
but my heart revolted at the mean idea - I gave both of them to Harriet , and bid her keep them till her uncle should be able to read them himself .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 262"/> About an hour after this , Sir William sent for Harriet ; the moment he saw her , he cried out , ' `` Where is she ? '' ' '
`` In her chamber , Sir , weeping your illness , and praying for your recovery ' - ` For my death , you mean . '' ' '
`` Indeed you wrong her , Sir ; I never saw any person so truly concerned for another . '' '
- ' `` Where is lord Lucan ?
Why do you blush , at that question ?
what then !
art thou become the confident , the vile accomplice , of your aunt 's infamy . '' ' '
`` Believe me , Sir , I never heard , or saw , a word or action of her 's , that should be called so - She is the best of women , '' ' - ' `` If that be true , the whole sex are past redemption - But where is Lord Lucan ? '' ' '
`` We left him at Elm-grove - My dear , dear uncle !
let me entreat you to compose yourself ; indeed you wrong my aunt most cruelly . '' '
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 263"/> She fell on her knees at his bedside , and kissed his hand .
- ' `` O Harriet !
I am but too well convinced that your expression refers more justly to her - It is she has wronged herself , and me too - But perhaps I have deserved to lose her affection , though mine was true to her .
- Yet for her own sake , for the honour of her family , I did not think she would have been abandoned - But d - n d - n her ! '' '
He wept , while he pronounced these horrid words !
</p>
<p>
Harriet described the strong emotion she had seen me feel , on hearing of his illness ; he wept again , yet called me an hyena ; and then cried out , ' `` Why does she not appear before me ?
O , she is conscious of her crime , and <page type="Page 264"/> dare not look upon me ! '' '
Harriet then acquainted him of the restraint his physician had imposed on me . '
`` It is very true , he replied , the sight of her would kill me !
but let her write , if she has any thing to say in her defence . '' '
</p>
<p>
She then gave him my letter - He seemed much agitated while he read it ; then said he was too weak to bear these painful conflicts , and bad her tell me he would receive me , as soon as he was able , but only to confront me with such proofs , as were indubitable , and never , from that moment , see me more .
</p>
<p>
Alas !
my sister , what will now become of me !
grant it were possible I could be able to undeceive Sir William , <page type="Page 265"/> and remove even the shadow of suspicion from his thoughts , must I not always live in fear ?
a fear which my own consciousness will still create !
That mutual band of conjugal felicity , a perfect confidence !
is now for ever broken - The gloomy reflections that dwell within my bosom will still appear , and raise up fresh disquiets and alarms within my husband 's breast : though he conceals his doubts , my heart will feel them , and secretly repine that even the sacrifice of my unhappy passion has not been able to procure his peace !
yet this is the sole prospect , this the compounding hope , of such a wretch as I !
</p>
<p>
Harriet has seen her uncle every day ; and , in consequence of their conversations , I have written to him twice - He <page type="Page 266"/> seems much affected while he reads my letters , and yet returns again to his unjust suspicions - Colonel Walter 's letter has been delivered to him ; he inquired whether I knew who it came from , and upon Harriet 's telling him I did , he replied , that has more weight with me than all that she has protested under her hand - There is , yet at least , some virtue in her .
</p>
<p>
Indeed , my sister , were I not convinced it is my duty to calm Sir William 's mind , I could , with the utmost composure , submit to , and sink under , the cruel calumny thrown out against me - The world , and all that it contains , seems to recede from my now feeble grasp - The dejection of my spirits has diffused an universal languor through <page type="Page 267"/> my whole frame , and some blessed intelligence whispers me , that soon , very soon , this poor torn heart will be at peace !
surely , my Fanny , you will , you ought , I mean , rejoice , at my deliverance !
</p>
<p>
I am glad of your happiness , of my brother 's , and of every one 's ; I could at this moment rejoice in a certainty of my being the only wretched creature upon earth .
- I wish I could prevent your sending a thought , or a sigh , this way !
your sorrow for my misery can but increase it - Strive to forget it , then , perhaps I may yet do so too - But never shall I cease to remember , that I am
</p>
<p>
your truly affectionate sister .
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 268"/> WOULD you believe it , Lucan , I am become a philosopher !
and that by the worst of all possible means , experience - I find there is no such thing as permanent happiness , for in the very moment that I looked down with pity upon kings , my cup has been dashed with a good smart dose of coloquintida .
</p>
<p>
For some time before my marriage , both Sir George Cleveland and I observed that my dear Fanny was frequently dejected , and melancholy ; but whenever we seemed to take notice of this indisposition of mind , she attributed it to the change of climate , and immediately assumed an air of chearfulness .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 269"/> For my own part , I sometimes thought that her uneasiness might proceed from a recollection of my former conduct , and therefore endeavoured to dissipate her suspicions , by every mark of the sincerest attachment - I flattered myself I had succeeded , as she had given me her hand without the least affectation of reluctance , which young ladies sometimes assume the appearance of , in order to enhance the value of the gift .
</p>
<p>
I think there never was a blither bridegroom than myself - indeed I felt myself most truly happy - Yet my Fanny 's fits of melancholy frequently returned , and I have sometimes surprised her in tears !
I used to kiss them off , and begged to know the cause ; she constantly evaded my request , but with <page type="Page 270"/> so much tenderness and delicacy , that I could not insist on her compliance , or even let her see that I was unhappy myself , lest it should render her more so .
</p>
<p>
In this kind of mortal state we passed several weeks ; but a letter that was delivered to her lately , has unravelled the mystery .
- We were alone in her dressing-room when it was brought to her - While she read it her countenance changed so visibly , that I could not avoid taken notice of it to her ; she burst into tears , and exclaimed , my unhappy sister !
What !
is she dead ?
I asked - Not yet , she answered , and sunk back as if near fainting in her chair - By Heaven , Lucan , I would not go through such another moment , for the diamond eyes of the Indian idol - I forget his name - that are computed to be worth a million and a half !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 271"/> As soon as she had recovered , she entreated me not to mention what had happened , to Sir George , or his lady ; then told me that Lady Barton was the most miserable being upon earth , from the villainy of a vile fellow who lives in their neighbourhood , and was himself in love with her , who , by a false accusation of her to her husband , has rendered him so outrageously jealous , as almost to endanger Sir William 's life ; that , from her sister 's letters , she had reason to believe that she also was dying , and implored me to set out for Ireland with her immediately , in order to rescue lady Barton , if possible , by removing her from that scene of misery and distress .
</p>
<p>
I readily acquiesced in her desire , discovering still new charms in her tender <page type="Page 272"/> and generous affection for her unhappy sister , which has been the sole source of her melancholy - She gave me many prudent reasons for not acquainting her brother with this affair ; so that our scheme was mentioned at dinner , as a sudden thought , and every thing was fixed for our setting out in two days - But pity me , Lucan , when I tell you that my whole of life , my heart 's dear Fanny , was taken ill that night , the next day grew much worse , and on the third , the physicians pronounced her disorder to be a miliary fever .
She is now , thank Heaven !
out of danger , but weak , low , and in her bed .
I did not know how truly , how fondly , I loved her , Lucan !
till now - I am not ashamed of the blot a tear has just made .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 273"/> Her impatience to set out for your country is unabated , but I fear it will be some time before her strength will be equal to the journey .
She has commanded me to write a few lines , in gayeté de coeur , to lady Barton , as if jealous of the correspondence between them , and saying that I will only allow her to answer her letters , in person - This is meant to excuse her silence , without alarming her about her illness - How tender , how considerate !
</p>
<p>
I hope to see you soon in Dublin , and that we shall return to England together ; if Lady Barton should come with us , we shall be a good melange enough for a parte quarré - I am resolved to be gay ; my wife will , I hope , be chearful , when she has rescued her sister <page type="Page 274"/> from the green-eyed monster - You will be polite , and agreeable , at least ; and I think lady Barton will have no great cause to be sorrowful at leaving a husband , with whom she has never been happy , as Fanny has now confessed to me , on this occasion .
</p>
<p>
In my next , I hope I shall be able to fix the day of our setting out - Till we meet , adieu , my dear Lucan ,
</p>
<p>
yours , HUME .
</p>
<p>
IT is over , my dear sister !
my trial and condemnation are past , and I now sink under the weight of his censure , from <page type="Page 275"/> which I neither ought , nor desire to appeal - Yesterday Sir William desired to see me ; I instantly obeyed his summons , and approached him pale and trembling - But my wanness was the effect of ill health , and my tremor arose from weakness - Yet he perhaps might have attributed these symptoms to guilt , or fear ; for a person arraigned , is generally half condemned .
</p>
<p>
I dreaded his flying into a rage at seeing me , but , to do him justice , he was unusually calm - As I entered the chamber , he said , ' `` I am sorry , Madam , that we should meet thus '' ' - I told him I was sincerely grieved for having been the innocent cause of so much uneasiness to him - He repeated the word innocent , and then launched out into the most cruel , <page type="Page 276"/> and I am happy to say , false accusation , that ever was uttered .
</p>
<p>
Wretched !
wretched man !
my heart this moment feels for what his must one day suffer !
He was violently agitated , while he proceeded in his accusation ; and I sometimes thought that he appeared to doubt the improbabilities he uttered , till he produced lord Lucan 's picture , which seemed like a visible miracle to corroborate the whole legend .
</p>
<p>
I offered not the least interruption , while he spoke ; but when he had ended , I threw myself upon my knees before him , and in the most solemn manner assured him , that I had never been guilty of an act of dishonour , though I confessed that my affections had not been inviolably <page type="Page 277"/> restrained to him ; perhaps from the harshness of his manners , perhaps from my own weakness .
</p>
<p>
He was variously affected whilst I spoke , and often broke out into extravagant exclamations , denying the truth of what I said , by recurring to the charge against me - At other times he appeared softened , for an instant ; but then the picture , like Othello 's handkerchief , still turned his heart to stone .
</p>
<p>
Why was I not at liberty to unravel that mystery ?
But my word was long since passed to keep it secret , and never shall that bond be forfeited ; nor shall my innocence ever be justified by dishonour .
Besides , this was but a circumstance , and that equivocal , at most .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 278"/> He then said , that as my family , all but myself , were truly respectable , he would , for their sakes , take some time to consider how he should act , before he branded me with infamy ; and that I might remain a prisoner in his house , till he had determined on my sentence - But from that moment interdicted me from quitting my apartment ; and , what was still much more severe , from seeing or conversing with my sole comfort , the tender , the affectionate , the amiable Harriet .
</p>
<p>
I wept , but it was in silence , and yielded to this hard decree without a murmur - He might have been more cruel to me - Benson is still permitted to attend me ; nor has he yet forbidden me the melancholy pleasure of writing to my <page type="Page 279"/> sister !
I thank him , most sincerely , for these two indulgencies , and most devoutly hope I shall not want them long .
</p>
<p>
While I live , I shall never cease to lament my being the fatal and sole source of sorrow to my beloved sister - O , dry your tears , my Fanny , and turn your eyes to happier views - See an adoring husband , and a tender brother court you to happiness - Forget the wretch that mars your present bliss , and renders you ungrateful for Heaven 's bounty .
</p>
<p>
My heart sinks in me - My friend , my little Harriet , is just sent away !
I hear the wheels that carry her from hence - they roll upon my heart !
protecting angels guard her innocence !
and soothe the sorrows of her tender mind !
<page type="Page 280"/> I know it , Benson , she was drowned in tears - I feel them stream this moment on my breast - Alas !
my Fanny , my head turns round , I can not write another line ,
</p>
<p>
Adieu , adieu !
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
DID you not think I was completely wretched when I last wrote to you ?
I thought so then , but find my error now - There is no bounds to miseries like mine ; the swelling waves rise upon one another , and overwhelm me - Why does this feeble bark struggle so long , why not sink down at once to dark oblivion !
But I will silence this repining heart , nor murmur at my sufferings .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 281"/> About eight o'clock , this morning , there arrived a messenger from Waltersburgh , and in a few minutes after , Sir William rushed into my room , with an appearance of frenzy in his air and countenance .
- ' `` Vilest of women ! '
cried he out , ' `` you have now completed your wickedness - But think not that either you , or your accomplice , shall escape - That pity , which pleaded in my weak heart , even for an adultress , will but increase my rage against the murderess of my friend . '' '
He then quitted me abruptly , as if bent upon some horrid purpose .
</p>
<p>
Yes , Fanny , I have heard my name traduced by the two vilest terms that ever disgraced human nature , and yet I neither sighed nor shed a tear - I became <page type="Page 282"/> petrified with horror , and fixed my eyes in stupid silence on the door at which Sir William issued , till Benson opened it some minutes after , and found me quite immoveable .
</p>
<p>
I blame him not for his intemperate wrath ; he thinks he has just cause - There has been a duel - Lord Lucan is in fault - he was the challenger - He has destroyed my fame and peace of mind , for ever !
It is but just it should be so , that he who caused my weakness , should punish it .
</p>
<p>
I hear that he is dangerously wounded , and Colonel Walter mortally - O could I hope my prayers might reach the throne of mercy !
But am I not , as Sir William stiles me , a murderess ?
too <page type="Page 283"/> surely so !
I am the fatal cause of all these crimes - forgive me , gracious Heaven !
No words can paint my agonies !
death only can relieve them .
</p>
<p>
A note from Sir William !
it has broke my heart - I fear I can not see to copy it .
</p>
<p>
Waltersburg .
</p>
<p>
MADAM ,
</p>
<p>
I know not how to plead the pardon , either of myself , or the unhappy Colonel Walter !
But if the strongest remorse for the injuries he has done you , added to the loss of life , which is now ebbing fast from his wound , may be thought an atonement , you will comply with his request , and grant him your forgiveness .
</p>
<p>
As to myself , I can only say that I have been most cruelly deceived , and <page type="Page 284"/> nothing but Colonel Walter 's present situation , confession , and contrition , could ever have induced me to forgive his having been the cause of so much unhappiness to you - I forgive him mine , because he has repaired it - My own offence , my own failings have rendered me charitable to his - But if Heaven shall spare my life , it shall be spent in penitence for the wrongs I have done you .
</p>
<p>
Colonel Walter entreats you will let him know , where his wife and child now are ?
Judge my surprise at hearing him acknowlege such connections !
But there is now no time for reflections , as doctor Hartford and the surgeon both say he has not long to live .
Death will be ease from the agonies he now endures in his tortured mind ; and I trust <page type="Page 285"/> in Heaven 's mercy , that they will ensure his future peace !
</p>
<p>
Be speedy , my much injured Louisa , in affording some relief to the most unhappy wretch I ever yet beheld , and in his pardon include that of your abused , and much afflicted husband ,
</p>
<p>
W. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
P.S. Lord Lucan 's wound is not dangerous - I will write for Harriet to return immediately to Southfield .
</p>
<p>
I wrote upon the instant , but even at this short interval can not recollect what I said - My sensations were too much diversified , too rapid , to leave strong traces on the memory - What did I not feel !
horror !
pity !
grief !
and even a gleam of joy !
joy that my name <page type="Page 286"/> shall not disgrace my family , nor make it hateful , when I shall be but dust !
</p>
<p>
Sir William 's kindness in restoring Harriet to me is the most pleasing proof that he could give of his returning confidence - I know that it will make her happy , and therefore do I doubly thank him - All other marks of his regard must come too late - We can not live together - Yet I feel that death alone will part us - His approaches have long been welcomed by me ; I have thought his harbingers were slow , and chid their tardy , though sure progress - Yet would I now delay their lingering steps , till I could sold my sister to my heart , then bid it cease to beat - This is a cruel but a natural wish - I will not press for the indulgence of it .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 287"/> I am most truly thankful that Lord Lucan 's life is safe , but can not form the least conjecture why he should hazard it , as he has done - It is impossible that he should know the injuries I have sustained from Colonel Walter - To you alone have I revealed my sufferings .
Even Harriet was a stranger to the cause of my distress , till Sir William 's violence informed her of his suspicions ; and sure I am , she would not publish my disgrace .
This is a point that I could wish was cleared - Yet of what moment is it to me now ?
</p>
<p>
I have just received a letter from Lord Hume - excuse my silence to him , and assure him of my affectionate regards - My truest tenderest love awaits my brother - and I charge you , Fanny , never <page type="Page 288"/> to let him know what I have suffered - it would wound his peace , when I shall be at rest .
</p>
<p>
Another note from Sir William , containing unbounded thanks for what he calls my condescending goodness - Can there be any merit in the forgiveness of one frail and erring being , to another !
I will try if I can rest - good-night , my dearest sister ,
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
SIR William returned , about ten o'clock this morning , from Waltersburgh , and I was not up - I used to be an early riser , Fanny - But may now say with Anna , in Douglas -
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 289"/> '' Thy votaries , Grief , great nature 's orders break , '' And change the midnight to the moon-tide hour . ''
It was near eleven before I rang my bell ; and though Sir William expressed the greatest impatience to see me , he would not suffer Benson to disturb me - Why do these petits soins appear too late for him or me to profit from !
As soon as she informed me that he was in the house , I rose and dressed me with the utmost expedition ; then sent to let him know that I was ready to receive his commands - I found my mind infinitely more agitated than when he had summoned me to appear before him ; yet I did not tremble as I then had done , but my heart beat quicker .
</p>
<p>
He approached me with a look of tender anxiety , which I had never seen <page type="Page 290"/> him wear ; I arose as he entered , he caught my hand and dropped upon one knee , ' `` Lady Barton , said he , it is impossible for words to express my feelings ; could you be sensible of what they are , you would both pardon and pity me ! '' '
I made the strongest effort in my power to raise him from the ground , but both my strength and speech forsook me , and I sunk motionless within his arms .
</p>
<p>
When I recovered , I found myself reclining upon Benson 's bosom , and Sir William walking about the room , like a distracted person , exclaiming , ' `` She is lost !
is gone for ever !
and I have killed her !
I am the murderer , now ! '' '
</p>
<p>
The moment I could speak , I said every thing in my power to calm his <page type="Page 291"/> mind , but he continued to accuse himself much more severely than he could deserve ; and when he looked upon my altered face , tears streamed from his sad eyes - Indeed I am much changed from what I was - I think you scarce could know me .
</p>
<p>
Colonel Walter is no more - Though I have no faith in the efficacy of prayers for the dead , yet I can not refrain from offering up mine - For religion , prompted by misfortunes , is apt to exceed to superstition .
But enough , or rather say too much , of this sad subject .
</p>
<p>
Harriet is returned - She started at seeing me - It is amazing what a visible alteration a few days has made in my appearance ; I do not myself perceive any <page type="Page 292"/> great internal change ; an encreasing weakness is all that I am sensible of - Death seems to be grateful for the ardent wishes I have so often made for him , and approaches me with the gentleness of a friend - The variety of terrors I have gone through , have disarmed him of his , and though they at present seem to be passed , ( pardon me , my sister ! )
I can not help considering my dissolution as a deliverance .
</p>
<p>
As soon as Harriet arrived , Sir William brought her by the hand , and presenting her to me , said , ' `` I am happy , my dear niece , to restore you again to the protection of the best , and most injured woman breathing - My future conduct to her , joined to your care and assiduity , will , I hope , restore her health , and make us all happy , once more . '' '
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 293"/> I bowed assent to Sir William 's impossible wish , and embraced my beloved Harriet with all the fondness of a mother - I shall be a loss to her , Fanny ; my heart melts at the idea of her distress - I am not able to hold the pen longer , at present , I will reassume it to-morrow .
</p>
<p>
I hope that contrary winds are the sole cause of my not hearing from you - The agitation of my mind , for some time past , has prevented my thinking too deeply on your silence - I flatter myself that the next post-day will prevent my future anxiety .
</p>
<p>
Adieu ,

<p>
<page type="Page 294"/> MY illness , or rather languor , encreases so fast upon me , that it is with much difficulty I can support myself in my chair , for an hour together ; yet they talk of carrying me to Lisbon - How absurd !
as if a long journey could cure a broken heart - Mine is the gentlest of decays ; the marks of my approaching dissolution are almost as visible in the faces that surround me , as in my own - Sir William is the very statue of grief ; no pen or pencil can describe the tender expression of concern and solicitude that appears in Harriet 's face - Benson is become a spectre ; and doctor <page type="Page 295"/> Hartford , though long used to look on the approaches of death , seems startled and affected by them now .
</p>
<p>
The unhappy affair of the duel has not yet been explained ; but I have neither curiosity or concern about that , or any thing else , now left - Even my unhappy passion have I long since sacrificed to my duty - Be witness , for me , Heaven !
that from the moment of Sir William 's danger , the fond delirium vanished from my heart , and left not even one tainted trace behind !
- You have known all the conflicts of my soul , and were there ought that could disturb it now , to you I would confess the painful perturbation , as to Heaven - but all is calm , my sister !
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 296"/> '' Still as the sea , e 're winds were taught to blow , '' Or moving spirit bad the waters flow , '' Soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiven , '' And mild , as opening gleams of promised Heaven . ''
May the last lines be prophetic !
Amen !
Adieu !
I will not yet say a last one , to my beloved sister .
</p>
<p>
L. BARTON .
</p>
<p>
P.S. .
You are at liberty to acquaint my brother with my situation - No stain will now reflect on him , from me .
My memory will still be dear to those I love , to him , to you , my sister - This thought will smooth my passage to the grave , and I shall rest in peace .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 297"/> Dear Hume ,
</p>
<p>
YOUR last letter has brought about a fatal event .
I shall make no merit of letting you into a secret , which is now at an end for ever !
Lady Barton was the charming woman , to whom my heart had dedicated my life .
Her beauty , purity , and frankness , sure never yet were equalled !
My attentions and regards , I fear , were too much marked towards her , for it seems they were taken notice of by a gentleman , Colonel Walter , who likewise visited at her house .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 298"/> This happened unfortunately to excite some jealousy in his breast .
Though how was it possible for such a being as her to inspire a love without honour !
He gave hints of his suspicion , though they then appeared to be of no consequence ; but upon reading your letter , my mind quickly referred to the persons in question , though you neither mentioned his name , or mine .
</p>
<p>
I was shocked at the falshood and villainy of the story - Had Lady Barton been an object of the utmost indifference to me , honour and humanity must have excited me to exculpate both her and myself , from so vile a slander - But , adoring her as I do !
mere justice was too lukewarm a principle of action - I added resentment to it .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 299"/> I set out immediately for his house , and charged him with his perfidy - He denied it at first , but when I had produced my voucher , he attempted to excuse himself , by saying , ' `` that as the lady had herself acknowledged a passion for me , to him , it required no great reach of philosophy to deduce the natural conclusion he had drawn from such premises . '' '
</p>
<p>
' `` I shall then render myself worthy of such a confession , said I , by chastising your breach of honour in repeating it . '' '
- I had come prepared , and told him so , desiring him to follow me to the end of a grove near the place , which he soon did - We were both wounded , but he mortally .
I took care of him home - He seemed sensible and sorry <page type="Page 300"/> for his crime , and said he would repair it - He is since dead .
</p>
<p>
Lady Barton is now languishing in the last stage of a consumption - And I am the most wretched being upon earth - I would fly out of the kingdom this moment , but that I must stay to take my trial here - Alas !
of what use would flight be to me - Can I leave the remembrance of my sorrows behind !
Let me see you as soon as you arrive , and be [ ... ] ieve me
</p>
<p>
your unhappy friend , LUCAN .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 301"/> Chester .
</p>
<p>
IN what terms shall I express the feelings of my heart , for my more than amiable , my unhappy sister !
her sufferings have brought me near the brink of the grave , and now that they are past , why does she cruelly refuse her own assent to life , and happiness ?
Live , my Louisa !
and do not doom me for ever to lament that I was blessed with such a friend !
</p>
<p>
I am scarce recovered from a dangerous fever , and yet have got so far on my way , to assist your recovery , unmindful of my own - Let not my fond attention be thrown away , I conjure you !
<page type="Page 302"/> but in pity to Sir William , to the gentle Harriet , and to me at least , exert a wish to live - I ask no more !
the rest may be expected from your youth , and the unceasing assiduity of such tender friends .
</p>
<p>
I have not strength to undertake a journey through Wales ; besides it must delay our meeting - I shall sail this night from Pargate - My dear lord trembles for what I may suffer from sea sickness - I can feel no ills but your 's - the moment we land , I shall set out for Southfield ; I hope I shall be there before this letter - I am incapable of writing , my fears distract me , yet I will strive to hope .
</p>
<p>
I acquainted my brother with every particular of your story , the moment I <page type="Page 303"/> had received your permission , which was the very hour before we parted - He wept , and would have accompanied me , if his Delia had been in a condition for travelling .
</p>
<p>
The tenderest of husband 's joins me in the most fervent prayers and wishes for your recovery - O live to be a witness of the happiness I experience from his kindness , and that happiness will be then complete - Adieu , my dearest sister !
</p>
<p>
F. HUME .
</p>
<p>
<page type="Page 304"/> Southfield .
</p>
<p>
YES , my dear brother , I have seen her !
but fear I shall not long enjoy that blessing - Death lies in ambush on her lovely cheek , and lurks beneath the dimples of her smiles .
</p>
<p>
My lord said she never looked so beautiful as now - I think so , too !
Why must those beauties perish in the grave ?
She was transported at seeing me , joy overpowered her feeble frame , she became quite exhausted , and was obliged to retire to her chamber , very early .
</p>
<p>
The next morning she sent for Sir William and me , into her dressing-room ; <page type="Page 305"/> She appeared more animated than I had ever seen her , when she addressed him thus - ' `` Heaven has indulged my utmost wish , in granting me the happiness of seeing my beloved sister ; but I should be unworthy of this blessing , if I did not endeavour that you also should be a gainer by it - Here , Sir William , pointing to me , here is the witness of my weakness and my virtue , every movement of my heart has been laid open to her view , and to her I dare appeal , to justify its purity , while with myself , she must condemn its frailty - If there yet needs a farther proof to satisfy you , I will entreat my Fanny to submit the letters which have passed between us , to your perusal - There you will see the conflicts of a weak , not wicked mind ; and for the <page type="Page 306"/> single trespass of my heart , though an involuntary one , I now upon my knees implore your pardon . '' '
</p>
<p>
Sir William caught her in his arms , before she could kneel , and bathed her face with his fast flowing tears - His voice was inarticulate , and he could scarce pronounce , ' '' 'T is I that ought to kneel , and sue for pardon , my angel !
my Louisa !
O spare yourself and me these strong emotions !
I , only I , have been to blame !
And could I now restore your life and happiness , by parting with my own , I should not think my punishment severe - But O , to lose you thus !
is misery extreme . '' '
</p>
<p>
How severely do I now reproach myself for not sooner acquainting you with the unhappy situation of our dear sister !
<page type="Page 307"/> Perhaps you might have rendered it more easy , and saved her precious life !
But it was at her request that I concealed it till Colonel Walter 's dying confession had cleared her innocence .
</p>
<p>
I can not write more , my heart is breaking !
soon , too soon !
shall I , I fear , subscribe myself your only and
</p>
<p>
affectionate sister , F. HUME .
</p>
<p>
Southfield ,
</p>
<p>
SHE is gone , for ever !
I shall no more behold her !
her gentle spirit took its flight to heaven , while these fond arms in vain endeavoured to support <page type="Page 308"/> the feeble frame from whence it parted - She sunk upon my bosom , and expired !
nor sigh nor groan gave warning of her death , she closed her eyes , and slept for ever !
</p>
<p>
No words can paint the grief and distraction , of her unhappy husband , the tender sorrow of the gentle Harriet , or the heart-felt anguish of your
</p>
<p>
afflicted sister , F. HUME .
</p>
<p>
THE END .
